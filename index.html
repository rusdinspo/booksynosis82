The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother&#x2019;s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married.<br><br>Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. <br><br>From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel.</p><p>Anne Tyler's <i>The Amateur Marriage</i> is not so much a novel as a really long argument. Michael is a good boy from a Polish neighborhood in Baltimore; Pauline is a harum-scarum, bright-cheeked girl who blows into Michael's family's grocery store at the outset of World War II. She appears with a bloodied brow, supported by a gaggle of girlfriends. Michael patches her up, and neither of them are ever the same. Well, not the same as they were before, but pretty much the same as everyone else. After the war, they live over the shop with Michael's mother till they've saved enough to move to the suburbs. There they remain with their three children, until the onset of the sixties, when their eldest daughter runs away to San Francisco. Their marriage survives for a while, finally crumbling in the seventies. If this all sounds a tad generic, Tyler's case isn't helped by the characteristics she's given the two spouses. Him: repressed, censorious, quiet. Her: voluble, emotional, romantic. Mars, meet Venus. What marks this couple, though, and what makes them come alive, is their bitter, unproductive, tooth-and-nail fighting. Tyler is exploring the way that ordinary-seeming, prosperous people can survive in emotional poverty for years on end. She gets just right the tricks Michael and Pauline play on themselves in order to stay together: "How many times," Pauline asks herself, "when she was weary of dealing with Michael, had she forced herself to recall the way he'd looked that first day? The slant of his fine cheekbones, the firming of his lips as he pressed the adhesive tape in place on her forehead." Only in antogonism do Michael and Pauline find a way to express themselves. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis in 1941 but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina.

His brutal warriors once again encroach upon Azeroth, laying siege to the newly constructed stronghold of Nethergarde Keep. There, the archmage Khadgar and the Alliance commander, Turalyon, lead humanity and its elven and dwarven allies in fighting this new invasion. <br> <br> Even so, disturbing questions arise. Khadgar learns of orcish incursions farther abroad: small groups of orcs who seem to pursue a goal other than simple conquest. Worse yet, black dragons have been sighted as well, and they appear to be aiding the orcs. To counter Ner'zhul's dark schemes, the Alliance must now invade the orcs' ruined homeworld of Draenor. Can Khadgar and his companions stop the nefarious shaman in time to stave off the destruction of two worlds?</p><p>Aaron Rosenberg writes novels, roleplaying games, and educational books.

Gratar growled, half-rising, his powerful shoulder muscles bunching. One arm whipped forward and down, fist descending in a blur -- and his fingers opened, the small bone cubes spilling from them to clatter upon the ground. </p> <p> "Hah!" Brodog laughed, tusks jutting up as his lips pulled back in a grin. "Only one!" </p> <p> "Damn!" Gratar sank back down onto his stone, sulking as he watched Brodog again gather the cubes and shake them vigorously. He didn't know why he kept throwing against Brodog -- the other orc practically always won. It was almost unnatural. </p> <p> <i>Unnatural</i>. A word that had nearly stopped having any meaning for Gratar. He glanced up at the stark red sky that filled the horizon, the sun a burning globe of the same shade. The world had not always been thus. Gratar was old enough to remember blue skies, a warm yellow sun, and thick green fields and valleys. He'd swum in deep, cool lakes and rivers, blissfully ignorant of how precious a thing water would one day become. One of the most basic needs of life, uncontaminated water was now brought in in casks and stingily parceled out. </p> <p> Rising, Gratar kicked idly at the ground before him, watching the red dust puff upward, parching his mouth, and he reached for the waterskin and drank sparingly. The dust covered his skin, dulling the green hue, lightening his black hair. Red everywhere, as if the world had been drenched in blood. </p> <p> Unnatural. </p> <p> But the most unnatural thing of all was the reason he and Brodog were stationed here, whiling away the dusk-clogged day with idle games of chance. Gratar looked past Brodog at the towering archway just beyond them and the shimmering curtain of energy that filled it. The Dark Portal. Gratar knew that the strange mystic doorway led to another world, though he had not passed through it himself -- none of his clan had. But he had watched as proud Horde warriors had entered the portal to win glory over the humans and their allies. Since then, a few orcs had returned to report the Horde's progress. But lately there had been nothing. No word, no scouts; nothing. </p> <p> Gratar frowned, ignoring the clattering sound of Brodog's tossing of the bones. Something about the portal seemed...different. Gratar stepped closer to the towering gateway, the hairs along his arms and chest tingling as he approached. </p> <p> "Gratar? It's your turn. What are you doing?" </p> <p> Gratar ignored Brodog. Squinting, he stared at the rippling veil of energy. What was going on beyond it, on that strange other world? </p> <p> As he watched the curtain's undulating shimmer grew and became more translucent, allowing Gratar to see through it as if through murky water. He squinted his eyes, peered intently -- and gasped, staggering back. </p> <p> Playing out before his eyes, as if he were watching a ritual enactment, was a fierce and violent battle. </p> <p> "What?" Brodog was beside him in an instant, the game forgotten, and then he was gaping as well. They both stared for a second before Gratar regained his wits. </p> <p> "Go!" he shouted at Brodog. "Tell them what's happening!" </p> <p> "Right -- the commander." Brodog's eyes were still glued to the scene before them. </p> <p> "No," Gratar replied sharply. He had a gut feeling that what was about to happen would be more than his commander was prepared to handle. But one orc he knew might be. "Ner'zhul. Get Ner'zhul -- he'll know what to do!" </p> <p> Brodog nodded and took off at a run, though not without glancing back a few times. Gratar heard him leave, but still his gaze was riveted to the battle that was so violent but so oddly veiled. He could see orcs, some of whom he thought he recognized, but they were fighting strange figures, shorter and more narrowly built but more heavily armored. The strangers -- they were called "humans," Gratar remembered -- were quick and as numerous as gnats, swarming over the beleaguered orcs and overpowering them one by one. How could his people be suffering such a defeat? Where was Doomhammer? Gratar saw no sign of the massive, powerful warchief. What had happened on that other world? </p> <p> He was still watching, sickly enraptured, when he heard the sound of approaching feet. He tore his gaze away to see that Brodog had returned with two others. One was a massive figure, larger by far than any orc and much stronger, with pale milky skin and heavy features. An ogre, and a mage, by the cunning Gratar saw glinting in his small, piggy eyes. More important than this towering figure was the orc who accompanied him, pushing his way forward right up to the portal itself. </p> <p> Though his hair was gray and his face heavily lined, Ner'zhul, chieftain of the Shadowmoon clan and once the most skilled shaman the orcs had ever known, was still powerfully built and his brown eyes were as sharp as ever. He stared at the portal and the vaguely glimpsed disaster unfolding behind its </p> <p> shimmer. </p> <p> "A battle, then," Ner'zhul said as if to himself. </p> <p> <i>And one the Horde is losing</i>, Gratar thought. </p> <p> "How long has -- " Ner'zhul began. Suddenly the space framed by the Dark Portal shifted, its energies swirling violently. A hand thrust from the curtain as if it were rising from water, gleams of light and shadow clinging to green skin as it breached the barrier. A head followed, then the torso, and then the orc was through. His war axe was still in his hand but his eyes were wild as he stumbled, then caught himself, racing past Ner'zhul and the others without even looking. </p> <p> Behind him came another orc, then another and another and another, until there was a flood of them, all racing to pass through the portal as fast as their feet would carry them. And not just orcs -- Gratar saw several ogres emerge, and a group of smaller, slighter figures with heavy hooded cloaks bridged the gap as well. One warrior caught Gratar's attention. Too tall and bulky to be a full orc, his features brutish enough to have some ogre blood in him, this one did not run with the air of panic the others did, but with purpose, as if he was running to something rather than from it. At his heels loped a massive jet-black wolf. </p> <p> An orc shoved past this warrior as they stepped from the portal, snarling at the obstruction. "Out of the way, half-breed!" the orc snapped, but the warrior merely shook his head, refusing to be baited at such a time. The wolf, however, snarled at the orc before the warrior silenced it with a sharp hand gesture. The wolf fell silent, utterly obedient, and the warrior dropped a huge hand on the black head with affection. </p> <p> "What has happened here?" Ner'zhul demanded loudly. "You!" The shaman pointed toward one of the unfamiliar creatures. "What manner of orc are you? Why cover your face so? Come here!" </p> <p> The figure paused, then suddenly shrugged and stepped closer to Ner'zhul. "As you wish," he said in a cold voice that had a slightly mocking tone to it. Despite the heat of the land's baked, lifeless soil, Gratar shivered. </p> <p> A mailed hand slid the hood back, and Gratar could not help crying out in horror. Perhaps the being's features had once been fine and regular, but no longer. The skin was a pale grayish green, and had burst open at the juncture where ear met jaw. A thin trickle of ooze glimmered. Swollen, cracked, purple lips drew back in a smile as the eyes glowed with malevolent humor and a fierce intelligence. </p> <p> The thing was obviously dead. </p> <p> Even Ner'zhul shrank back, though he rallied quickly. "Who -- what are you?" Ner'zhul demanded in a voice that shook only a little. "And what do you want here?" </p> <p> "Don't you recognize me? I am Teron Gorefiend," the figure replied, chuckling at the shaman's obvious discomfiture. </p> <p> "Impossible! He is dead and gone, slaughtered by Doomhammer along with the rest of the Shadow Council!" </p> <p> "Dead I am indeed," the creature agreed, "but not gone. Your old apprentice Gul'dan found a way to bring us back, and into these rotting carcasses." He shrugged, and Gratar could hear the lifeless flesh creak in slight protest. "It suffices." </p> <p> "Gul'dan?" The old shaman seemed more shocked by that revelation than by the sight of the walking corpse in front of him. "Your master still lives? Then you should return to him. You forsook me and the shaman tradition to follow his lead and become a warlock when you lived, abomination. Serve him now that you are dead." </p> <p> But Gorefiend was shaking his head. "Gul'dan is dead. And good riddance. He betrayed us, halving the Horde at a crucial moment and forcing Doomhammer to pursue him instead of conquering a human city. That treachery cost us the war." </p> <p> "We...have <i>lost</i>?" Ner'zhul stammered. "But...how is that possible? The Horde covered the very plains, and Doomhammer would not go down without a fight!" </p> <p> "Oh, he fought," Gorefiend agreed. "Yet all his might was not enough. He killed the humans' leader but was overpowered in turn." </p> <p> Ner'zhul seemed stunned, turning to look at the panting, bloodied orcs and ogres who had rushed through the gates moments earlier. He took a deep breath and straightened, turning to the ogre who had accompanied him. "Dentarg -- summon the other chieftains. Tell them to gather here at once, bringing only weapons and armor. We -- " </p> <p> The wave washed out of the portal with no warning, a massive energy burst that slammed all of them to the ground. Gratar gasped for breath, the wind knocked out of him. He stumbled to his feet, only to be greeted by a second explosion, more violent than the first. This time hunks of stone had been snatched up by the energy that powered the portal and came flying past them, chips and slabs and slivers and sheets. The curtain wavered, becoming opaque. </p> <p> "No!" Ner'zhul raced toward the portal. He was still several feet away when the shimmering curtain of light flickered, contracted, froze -- and then exploded. Stones and dust erupted from the archway. Ner'zhul was tossed into the air like an old bone, and struck the earth hard. Dentarg let out an angry bellow and rushed to his master's side, scooping him up as if he weighed noth...</p></p><h2>Webster&#39;s New World Hebrew Dictionary</h2><p>Now updated with a fresh new look!&nbsp;With more than 50,000 entries, the Webster&#x2019;s New World<i>�</i> Hebrew Dictionary is a bilingual dictionary requiring no prior knowledge of Hebrew.&nbsp;Hebrew entry words in the Hebrew-English part of the dictionary are presented in Latin alphabetical order familiar to English speakers.

The apartment was large and elegant, with a view of Central Park. Diana and Eric had lived there for nineteen of the thirty-two years they'd been married, and for most of those years their two daughters had lived there with them. Both girls had moved out only in the last few years, Samantha to an apartment of her own when she graduated from Brown, and Katherine when she got married five years before. They were good girls, bright and loving and fun, and despite the expected skirmishes with them in their teens, Diana got along with them extremely well, and she missed them, now that they'd grown up.<br><br>But she and Eric had enjoyed their time alone. At fifty-five, she was still beautiful, and Eric had always been careful to keep the romance fresh between them. He heard enough stories through his work to understand what women needed from their men. At sixty, he was a handsome, youthful-looking man, and a year before he had talked Diana into getting her eyes done. He knew she would feel better if she did. And he'd been right, as she checked the table again that she had set for New Year's Eve, she looked glorious in the candlelight. The minor cosmetic surgery she'd had, had knocked ten years off her age.<br><br>She had let her hair go white years before, and it shimmered like fresh snow in a well-cut, angled bob that showed off her delicate features and big blue eyes. Eric always told her that she was as pretty as she'd been when they met. She'd been a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian, when he was an obstetrical resident, and they'd gotten married six months later, and been together ever since. She'd stopped working when she got pregnant with Katherine, and stayed home after that, busy with the girls, and understanding with Eric as he got up night after night, to deliver babies. He loved his work, and she was proud of him.<br><br>He had one of the most successful ob/gyn practices in New York, and he said he wasn't tired of it yet, although two of his partners had retired the year before. But Eric still didn't mind the hours, and Diana was used to it by now. It didn't bother her when he left in the middle of the night, or had to cancel out of dinner parties at the last minute. They'd been living that way for more than thirty years. He worked on holidays and weekends, and loved what he did. He had been there with their daughter Katherine when both of her boys were born.<br><br>They were the perfect family in many ways, and life had been good to them. Theirs was an easy, fulfilling life, and a solid marriage. Diana kept busy now that the girls were grown, doing volunteer work at Sloan-Kettering, and organizing fund-raisers for research. She had no desire to go back to nursing once the girls grew up, and she knew she'd been out of it for too long. Besides, she had other interests now, her life had grown by leaps and bounds around her. Her charity work, the time she spent with Eric, their many interests, their trips, and her two grandsons filled her days.<br><br>As she stood in the dining room, she turned as she heard Eric walk into the living room, and for an instant, he stood in the doorway of the dining room, smiling at her, as their eyes met. The bond between them was evident, the solidity of their marriage rare.<br><br>"Good evening, Mrs. Morrison . . . you look incredible." His eyes said it even before his words did. It was always easy to see, and to know, how much he loved her. He had a handsome, boyish face, strong features, a cleft chin, eyes the same bright blue as her own, and his hair had drifted effortlessly from sandy blond to gray. He looked particularly handsome in his dinner jacket, he was trim, and in good shape, with the same narrow waist and broad shoulders he had had when they got married. He rode a bike in the park on Sunday afternoons, and played tennis whenever he wasn't on call on the weekend. And he either played squash or swam, no matter how tired he was, every night when he finished at the office. The two of them looked like an ad for healthy, attractive middle-aged people. "Happy New Year, sweetheart," he added as he walked over, put an arm around her, and kissed her. "What time are they coming?" "They" referred to the two couples who were their favorite companions and best friends.<br><br>"At eight," she said, as she checked the champagne cooling in a silver bucket, and he poured himself a martini. "Or at least Robert and Anne will. Pascale and John should be here sometime before midnight." He laughed as he dropped an extra olive in his glass and glanced at Diana.<br><br>Eric and John Donnally had gone to Harvard together, and been friends ever since. They were as different as night and day. Eric was tall and lean, easygoing, open, and generous of spirit. He loved women, and as he did every day in his practice, he could spend hours talking to them. John was stocky, powerful, irascible, ornery, argued constantly with his wife, and pretended to have a roving eye, although no one had ever actually seen him do anything about it. And in truth, John loved his wife, although he would rather have died than admit it publicly, even among his closest friends. Listening to him and Pascale talk was like hearing a series of rapid-fire explosions. She was as volatile as he was, and eight years younger than Diana. Pascale was French and had been dancing with the New York City Ballet when John met her. She was twenty-two years old when they met, and twenty-five years later, she was as tiny and graceful as she had been then, with big green eyes, dark brown hair, and an incredible figure. She had been teaching ballet for the past ten years, in her spare time. There were only two obvious things that were similar about Pascale and John--neither one was ever punctual--and both had difficult dispositions, and loved to argue, for hours on end. They had turned the art of bickering into an olympic sport.<br><br>The last of Eric and Diana's guests for New Year's Eve were Robert and Anne Smith. They had met the Morrisons thirty years before when Eric delivered Anne's first baby, and their friendship with the Morrisons was born at the same time. Anne and Robert were both attorneys. She was still practicing, at sixty-one, and Robert had become a superior court judge. At sixty-three, he had the appropriately solemn looks that went with his position. But his sometimes dour demeanor was a mask for a kind and gentle heart. He loved his wife, his children, and his friends. He was tall and good looking, and deeply devoted to Anne, and their three children. Eric had delivered all three, and had become one of Anne's favorite friends.<br><br>Robert and Anne had married in law school, and had been together for thirty-eight years. They were the elder statesmen of the group, seemed the most staid, mostly because of their jobs. But they were warm and lively among friends, and had their own style, as the others did as well. They weren't as colorful or as excitable as Pascale and John, or as youthful and stylish in their looks as Eric and Diana. Robert and Anne looked their age, but were young at heart. The six friends were deeply attached to each other, and always had a good time together. They saw a lot of each other, more so than other friends.<br><br>They had dinner once or twice a month, and had shared their joys and hopes and disappointments over the years, their concerns about their children, and even Pascale's deep grief when she was never able to have children. She had wanted them desperately once she retired from the ballet, but it had never worked out for her, and even the fertility specialists Eric sent her to had been unable to do anything for them. Half a dozen attempts at in vitro, and even donor eggs, had been fruitless. And John had stubbornly refused to even consider adopting. He didn't want "someone else's juvenile delinquent," he wanted his own, or none at all. So at forty-seven and sixty, they were childless, and had only each other to rail at, which they both did often, on a variety of subjects, most of the time much to the amusement of the others, who were accustomed to the heated arguments Pascale and John made no attempt to hide and seemed to enjoy.<br><br>The three couples had chartered a sailboat in the Caribbean together once, and rented a house in Long Island several times. They had gone to Europe together more than once, and always enjoyed their joint travels. Despite their very different styles, they were totally compatible, and the best of friends. They not only tolerated each other's foibles, but understood each other in important ways. They had shared a lot of history with each other over time.<br><br>It was fitting that they spend New Year's Eve together. And for the past two decades, it had been a tradition that all three couples cherished, and counted on every year. They rotated houses from year to year, going to Robert and Anne's for quiet, early evenings some years, which ended just after the stroke of midnight, or to John and Pascale's, for disorganized, hastily thrown together, but delicious dinners, and the champagne and wines John and Pascale argued about and collected. She preferred French wines, and he opted for California. But everyone's favorite locale for New Year's Eve was Eric and Diana's. Their home was comfortable and elegant, the cook Diana used for evenings like these was excellent and capable, and never intruded, the food was good, the wines were great, and in their impeccably decorated apartment, everyone felt they had to look their best and be on their best behavior. Even Pascale and John made an effort to behave when they came there, although they didn't always succeed, and some minor argument would erupt about the name of a wine neither of them could remember, or a trip they wanted to take. John loved Africa, and Pascale the South of France, and often John would make inflammatory comments about Pascale's mother, whom he hated. He pretended to hate France, the French, and everything about them, including and most especially his mother-in-law, and Pascale would cheerfully reciprocate, with acerbic comments about his mother in Boston. But despite their quirks and vagaries, there was no doubt about the fact that the six friends were far more than fond of each other. Theirs was a deep bond of affection, which had withstood the test of time, and no matter how often or seldom it was, they looked forward to seeing each other. And best of all, whenever they were together, all six of them had a good time.<br><br>The doorbell rang at exactly seven-fifty-nine, and neither Eric nor Diana was surprised when she opened the door, and found Anne in a high-necked black evening gown with discreet pearl earrings, her gray hair combed into a bun, and Robert in a tuxedo, with perfectly groomed snow-white hair, standing on the doorstep, smiling at them.<br><br>"Good evening," Robert said with a twinkle in his eye as he bent from his considerable height to kiss Diana, and the foursome wished each other a happy New Year. "Are we late?" Robert asked, looking concerned. Robert was punctual to a fault, as was Anne. "The traffic was awful." They lived in the East Eighties, whereas Pascale and John had to come from their apartment near Lincoln Center, on the West Side. But God only knew when they would get there. And to complicate matters further, it had started snowing, which would make it hard to find a cab.<br><br>Anne took off her wrap, and smiled at Diana. Although she was only six years older than Diana, Anne looked like her mother. She had warm brown eyes, and wore her silvery-gray hair in a bun. She was a pretty woman, but had never concentrated on her looks. She wore almost no makeup, and had exquisite creamy skin. She preferred to spend her time on art, theater, obscure books, and music, when she wasn't busy with her family practice law firm. She was an advocate for children's rights, and had spent huge amounts of time in recent years, helping to set up programs for abused women. It was a labor of love for which she had received numerous awards. She and Robert shared their passion for the law, the plight of children and the abused, and both were well known for espousing liberal causes. Anne had thought long and hard about going into politics years before, and had been encouraged to do so, but had decided against it, for the sake of her husband and children. She preferred private to public life, and had no desire for the attention it would have focused on her. In spite of her considerable professional abilities, she was an admirably unassuming person, to the point of being humble, and Robert was proud of her. He was one of her most vocal fans.<br><br>As Anne sat down in the living room, Eric sat down next to her on the couch and put an arm around her. "So where have you been for the past two weeks? I feel like we haven't seen you in ages." Robert and Anne had spent the holidays in Vermont, as they always did, with their children and grandchildren. They had two married sons, and a single daughter, who had only recently finished law school. But no matter where Anne and Robert were, or what they did, they always came back to spend New Year's Eve with their friends. They had missed only one year, when Anne's father had died and she had to go to Chicago, to be with her mother. But other than that, this was a sacred engagement every year, for all six of them.<br><br>"We were in Sugarbush, changing diapers and looking for lost mittens," Anne explained to Eric with a smile. She had a kind face, and laughing eyes. They had five grandchildren, and two daughters-in-law whom Diana had always sensed Anne didn't like, although she would never have said it out loud. Neither of her daughters-in-law worked, and Anne didn't approve of the extent to which her sons indulged them. She thought women should work too. She always had. And in the privacy of their own home, Anne had said to Robert repeatedly that she thought their daughters-in-law were spoiled.</p><h2>Prophet</h2><p><p>Anchorman John Barrett knows something is wrong.

Do we become angels when we die? Are angels always hovering nearby, on guard to protect us from danger? Can we talk to them? Many of our ideas about angels come from the media, which is more interested in ratings and ticket sales than truth. It's important for Christians to understand what angels really are.<br><br>Pastor Jack Graham walks you through Scripture, revealing the truth about angels and what they offer us: encouragement, counsel, confirmation of God's will, strength, protection, wisdom, companionship, and more. Focusing on practical application, Dr. Graham separates fact from fiction and demonstrates that the main role of angels isn't to draw attention to themselves, but to point us toward Christ.<br><br>***<br><br>"I consider Jack Graham to be a key voice for the church in these turbulent days.

Each chapter holds up to the light a different character trait--Christ's forgiveness, for example, or his perspective, or his strength--and asks you, the reader, to consider what the ancient encounter has to say to us today.<br><br>It is a whisper-thin veil that separates the natural from the supernatural, meaning divine activity is all around us.

It gave me a thrill writing the age I&#x2019;d be on my next birthday because everyone knew that once you hit double digits, you weren&#x2019;t a child anymore. The green chalk, borrowed from the scoreboard of my father&#x2019;s dartboard without his knowledge, was so stubby that my fingers scraped against the concrete of the driveway as I put the final touches to my creation.</p><p>&#x201c;There, it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d; I stood back and studied my handiwork. As usual, I was disappointed that something I&#x2019;d made hadn&#x2019;t turned out quite as good as I&#x2019;d imagined. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; Cat declared, reading my mind as she always did, and trying to reassure me before I washed the grid off in a fit of self doubt.&nbsp; I smiled even though her opinion shouldn&#x2019;t have counted for much; my identical twin sister was easily impressed by everything I did. &#x201c;You go first,&#x201d; Cat said. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; </p><p>I pulled the bronze half-cent coin from my pocket, and rubbed it for luck before launching it into the air from my thumbnail. It arced and spun, glinting in the sunlight, and when it finally landed in the first square, I launched myself forward, eager to finish the grid in record time. </p><p>I finished three circuits before the coin skittered out of the square marked &#x2018;4&#x2019;. It should have ended my turn, but I shot a quick look at Cat who was distracted by a hadeda bird making a racket on the neighbour&#x2019;s roof. Before she could notice my mistake, I nudged the coin back in place with the tip of my canvas shoe and carried on jumping.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing so well,&#x201d; Cat called a few seconds later once she&#x2019;d turned back and noticed my progress. </p><p>Spurred on by her clapping and encouragement, I hopped even faster, not noticing until it was too late that a lace on one of my <i>takkies </i>had come loose. It tripped me up just as I cleared the last square and brought me crashing down knee-first, my skin scraped raw on the rough concrete. I cried out, first in alarm and then in pain, and it was this noise that brought my mother&#x2019;s flip-flops clacking into my line of vision. Her shadow fell over me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh for goodness sake, not again.&#x201d; My mother reached down and yanked me up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so clumsy. I don&#x2019;t know where you get it from.&#x201d; She tsked as I raised my bleeding knee so she could see. </p><p>Cat was crouched next to me, wincing at the sight of the gravel imbedded in the wound. Tears started to prickle, but I knew I had to stop their relentless progression quickly or suffer my mother&#x2019;s displeasure.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. It&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; I forced a watery smile and gingerly stood up.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Robin,&#x201d; my mother sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to cry, are you? You know how ugly you are when you cry.&#x201d; She crossed her eyes and screwed up her face comically to illustrate her point and I forced the giggle she was looking for.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to cry,&#x201d; I said.&nbsp; Crying in the driveway in plain sight of the neighbours would be an unforgiveable offense; my mother was very concerned with what other people thought and expected me to be as well. </p><p>&#x201c;Good girl.&#x201d; She smiled and kissed me on the top of my head as a reward for my bravery.</p><p>There was no time to savour the praise. The trill of the ringing phone cut through the morning and just like that, one of the last tender moments my mother and I would ever share was over. She blinked and the warmth in her eyes turned to exasperation. </p><p>&#x201c;Get Mabel to help clean you up, okay?&#x201d; </p><p>She&#x2019;d just disappeared through the back door into the kitchen when I became aware of whimpering and looked down to see that Cat was crying. Looking at my sister was always like looking into a mirror, but in that instant, it felt as though the glass between my reflection and me had been removed so that I wasn&#x2019;t looking at an image of myself; I was looking at myself. </p><p>The misery etched onto Cat&#x2019;s scrunched-up features was my misery. Her blue eyes welled with my tears and her pouty bottom lip trembled. Anyone who&#x2019;d ever doubted the veracity of twin empathy only had to see my sister suffering on my behalf to become a true believer.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stop crying,&#x201d; I hissed. &#x201c;Do you want Mom calling you a cry baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it looks like it hurts.&#x201d; </p><p>If only it were that straightforward in the eyes of our mother. &#x201c;Go to our room so she won&#x2019;t see you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and only come out when you feel better.&#x201d; I tucked a strand of brown hair behind her ear.</p><p>&nbsp;She sniffed and nodded, and then scurried inside with her head bent. I followed a minute later and found our maid, Mabel, in the kitchen washing up the breakfast dishes. She was wearing her faded mint-green uniform (a coverall dress that was too tight on her plump frame, the buttons gaping apart where they fastened in the front) with a white apron and <i>doek</i>.</p><p>My mother was on the phone in the dining room using the carefree, happy voice she only ever used with one person: her sister, Edith. I left her to it, knowing that if I asked to speak to my aunt, I&#x2019;d be told either to stop interrupting grown-ups&#x2019; conversations, or to stop being so in love with the sound of my own voice. </p><p>&#x201c;Mabel, look.&#x201d; I said as I lifted up my knee, relieved that it wasn&#x2019;t one of her few Sundays off.</p><p>She cringed when she saw the blood, and her hands flew up to her mouth, sending suds flying.&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Yoh</i>! <i>Yoh</i>! <i>Yoh</i>! I&#x2019;m sorry! I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201d; she exclaimed as though she&#x2019;d personally caused my suffering. </p><p>To me, this litany was better than all the plasters in the world and an immediate balm to my pain.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;Sit. I must see.&#x201d; She knelt down and inspected the scrape, wincing as she did so. &#x201c;I will fetch the first aid things.&#x201d; She pronounced it &#x2018;<i>festaid</i>&#x2019; in her strong accent and I savoured the word as I savoured all Mabel-English. I loved how she made regular English words sound like a totally different language, and I wondered if her children (whom I&#x2019;d never met and who lived in Qua-Qua all year round) spoke the same way. </p><p>She fetched the kit out from the scullery cupboard and knelt down again to tend to the graze, the cotton ball looking especially white against her brown skin. She soaked it with orange disinfectant and then held it to the wound, murmuring words of comfort each time I tried to pull away from the sting of it.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry! <i>Yoh</i>, I&#x2019;m sorry, see? I am almost finished. Almost, almost. You are a brave girl.&#x201d; <i>You arra brev gell</i>.</p><p>I basked in her focused attention and watched as she blew on my knee, amazed at how the tickle of her breath magically eased the pain. Once Mabel was satisfied that the broken skin was clean enough, she stuck a huge plaster over it and pinched my cheek. </p><p>&#x201c;Mwah, mwah, mwah.&#x201d; She placed lip-smacking kisses all over my face, and I held my breath waiting to see if this would be the day I finally got a kiss on the mouth. Her lips came as close as my chin before returning to my forehead. &#x201c;All better now!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you!&#x201d; I gave her a quick hug before heading out again, and I&#x2019;d just stepped out the back door when my father called me.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Freckles!&#x201d; He was sitting in a deck chair next to the portable <i>braai</i> he&#x2019;d set up in the bright patch of sunlight in the middle of the brown lawn. &#x201c;Get your old man a beer.&#x201d;</p><p>I ducked inside again and opened the fridge, pulling out a bottle of Castle Lager. My inexpert handling of the bottle opener resulted in a spray of foam across the linoleum floor but I didn&#x2019;t stop to wipe it up. Mabel clucked as I made a run for it, but I knew she&#x2019;d clean it without complaint.</p><p>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; I said handing the still-foaming bottle to my father who immediately used it to douse the flames that had leapt up beyond the barrier of the grill.</p><p>&#x201c;Just in time,&#x201d; he said, nodding for me to sit in the chair next to him. </p><p>My father&#x2019;s blue eyes twinkled out at me from a handsome face that was mostly hidden behind a thicket of hair. Wavy blonde curls flopped over his eyebrows in the front, and grew long at the back so that they dipped over his shirt collar. He&#x2019;d also cultivated long mutton chop sideburns that just fell short of meeting up with his bushy moustache. Kissing him was always a ticklish undertaking, and I loved the bristly texture of his face against my skin. </p><p>I sat down and he handed me the<i> braai</i> tongs as if he was passing me a sacred object. He nodded in a solemn way and I nodded back to show I acknowledged the transference of power.&nbsp; I was now in charge of the meat. </p><p>My father smiled as I leaned into the smoke rising from the grill, and then he glanced at the plaster on my knee. &#x201c;You been through the wars again, Freckles?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded and he laughed. My father often joked about having a son in a daughter&#x2019;s body. He especially loved to tell the story of how I&#x2019;d come home from my first and only ballet lesson when I was five years old with ripped tights and my leg covered in blood. When he&#x2019;d asked me how in the world I&#x2019;d managed to get so roughed up in a dancing class, I confessed that I&#x2019;d injured myself falling out of the tree I&#x2019;d climbed in order to hide away from the teacher. He&#x2019;d roared with laughter, and my mother had lectured me about wasting their money.</p><p>Teaching me how to <i>braai </i>was something my father should&#x2019;ve taught a son. If he felt cheated that he never got one, he never said so, and he encouraged my tomboyish behaviour at every opportunity.</p><p>Cat, on the other hand, was a sensitive child and in many ways, my complete opposite. She was also squeamish about raw meat. There was no way my father would ever have taught her the subtleties of cooking meat to perfection, or how to hold your fist when throwing a knockout punch, or how to bring someone down with a rugby tackle.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, now turn the <i>wors</i>. Make sure you get the tongs under all the coils and flip them together or it&#x2019;s going to be a big mess. Good. Now, nudge the chops to the side or they&#x2019;re going to be overdone. You want to crisp the fat but not burn it.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed his instructions carefully and managed to cook the meat to his satisfaction. Once we were done, I carried the meat in a pan to the table Mabel had set for us on the flagstone patio. The garlic bread, potato salad and <i>mielies</i> were all already there, protected under a fly net that I sometimes used as a veil when I played at being a spy disguised as a bride.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell your mother we&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; my father said as he sat down. He didn&#x2019;t trust the giant hadedas with their long beaks not to swoop down and steal the meat; they often swiped dog food left outside in bowls, and had been known to go for bigger prey like fish in ornamental ponds.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s on the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, tell her to get off. I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready to eat,&#x201d; I yelled around the doorway before stepping back outside again.</p><p>I&#x2019;d just sat down next to my father when Cat trailed outside to join us. She&#x2019;d washed all evidence of tears from her face, and smiled as our mother sat down next to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Who was that on the phone?&#x201d; My father asked, reaching for the butter and Bovril spread to slather over his <i>mielie</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>My father rolled his eyes. &#x201c;What does she want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. She&#x2019;s got some vicious stomach bug that&#x2019;s going around and she&#x2019;s been grounded until it clears.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s a huge crisis in her life? Not being able to serve shitty airplane food on overpriced flights to hoity toity passengers. God, your sister can make a mountain out of a molehill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a crisis, Keith. Who said it was a crisis? She just wanted to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to suck you into the drama of her life, more like it.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother raised her voice. &#x201c;What drama?&#x201d; </p><p>Cat&#x2019;s eyes were wide as they darted between our parents. She pulled her gaze away from them and stared at me. Her meaning was clear. <i>Do something! </i></p><p>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s a drama with her,&#x201d; my father said, matching my mother&#x2019;s increased volume. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s never just a small hiccup; it&#x2019;s always the end of the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the end of the world! Who said it&#x2019;s the end of the world?&#x201d; My mother thwacked the serving spoon back into the salad bowl. She glowered at him and the vein in her forehead began to bulge, never a good sign. &#x201c;God! Why must you always give her a hard time? She just wanted to -&#x201d;</p><p>The doorbell rang. </p><p>Cat&#x2019;s expression of relief said it all. <i>Saved by the bell!</i></p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; My father threw down his cutlery so that it clattered across the table. &#x201c;Look at the time. Who has no bloody manners rocking up at lunchtime on a Sunday?&#x201d; My mother stood to go but my father held her back. &#x201c;Let Mabel get it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told her to take the afternoon off and said she could come in tonight to do the dishes.&#x201d;</p><p>As my mother disappeared into the house, my father called after her. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, tell them to piss off or I&#x2019;ll shoot them. Tell them I have a big gun and I&#x2019;m not afraid to use it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder who it is.&#x201d; Cat asked and I shrugged. I was more interested in the gun. </p><p>When my mother returned a few minutes later, she was flushed and carrying two books which she thumped down on the table in front of Cat.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; My father asked. &#x201c;Who was at the door?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gertruida Bekker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hennie&#x2019;s wife?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What did she want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To complain about Robin who&#x2019;s apparently corrupting her daughter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; My father looked at me. &#x201c;What did you do, Freckles?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother nodded at the books. &#x201c;You gave those to Elsabe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t give them to her. I borrowed them to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lent them,&#x201d; my mother corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, lent them.&#x201d;</p><p>My father reached across the table to pick up the books. &#x201c;&#x2018;The Magic Faraway Tree&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Famous Five&#x2019;,&#x201d; he read. &#x201c;Books by Enid Blyton?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, apparently Gertruida took exception to the character&#x2019;s names and told me, in no uncertain terms, that Robin is a bad influence and she doesn&#x2019;t want her playing with Elsabe anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What names? What is the bloody woman talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>My mother paused before answering. &#x201c;Dick and Fanny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you being serious?&#x201d;</p><p>My mother nodded. &#x201c;Yes, she said they&#x2019;re disgusting names that shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed in a Christian household.&#x201d;</p><p>My father guffawed and that set my mother off. They were both in fits of giggles and it was my turn to look to Cat in mystification. I didn&#x2019;t know what was so funny. </p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to upset Elsabe or Mrs Bekker; all I&#x2019;d tried to do was start my own secret society like the children in the books.

Titanic, 1912</h2><p>One of the most popular Dear America diaries of all time, Ellen Emerson White's bestselling VOYAGE ON THE GREAT TITANIC is now back in print with a gorgeous new package!<br><br>Five years ago, Margaret Ann Brady's older brother left her in the care of an orphanage and immigrated to America. When the orphanage receives an unusual request from an American woman looking for a traveling companion, Margaret's teachers agree that she is the perfect candidate to accompany Mrs. Carstairs on the TITANIC, so that once Margaret arrives in New York she will be free to join her brother in Boston. But the TITANIC is destined for tragedy, and Margaret's journey is thrown into a frozen nightmare when the ship collides with an iceberg.</p><p>Ellen Emerson White has written several critically acclaimed novels for young adults, among them THE PRESIDENT&#39;S DAUGHTER, and its follow-up, LONG MAY SHE REIGN, as well as LIFE WITHOUT FRIENDS and LONG LIVE THE QUEEN. Ms. White graduated from Tufts University with a BA in English. She also studied fire science and police science at John Jay College in New York City and is certified to teach high school English. Her interests include the Vietnam War, cooking, downhill skiing, the Boston Red Sox, the New England Patriots, jazz, reading, politics, and pets.Grade 4-8-The hopes and dreams of a young girl are beautifully conveyed through White's engaging narrative. Orphaned Margaret Ann looks forward to the day when she will have enough money to leave London to be reunited with her brother in America. She is given that opportunity when she becomes the companion to Mrs. Carstairs, a wealthy American returning to the States. Their voyage aboard the Titanic is a thrilling experience for Margaret until disaster strikes. Readers will be drawn to this 13-year-old's humble, friendly disposition. Friendship, courage, and fortitude are themes that resonate throughout the novel, contributing to its structural integrity. The story's historical significance is evident in Margaret's descriptions of the liner, the famous people she encounters, and the events leading up to the tragedy. A strong female protagonist and a flowing, descriptive narrative result in a powerful book about human frailty and courage in the face of adversity. Poignant scenes of familial love and friendship are believable, and Margaret's spiritual and emotional growth are evident by the course her life takes after the trauma. Archival photos and a time line bring the reality of the situation to light. A heartwarming story with wide appeal.<br><i>Janet Gillen, Great Neck Public Library, </i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Return (Spirit Animals: Fall of the Beasts, Book 3) (3)</h2><p>Split between two worlds, Conor, Abeke, Meilin, and Rollan are four young heroes who are racing to stop an ancient evil.

It reveals him struggling with Latin grammar at prep school, charging the Dervishes at Omdurman and preparing his first political speech for a Conservative fete.</p><p>The voice of a vanished England speaks from the pages of Winston Churchill's evocative memoir of his first 30 years (1874-1904). The young Churchill inhabits a world in which men fight like hell in meaningless colonial wars--India, Egypt, South Africa--soldiering across the imperial map then extending the hand of friendship to their erstwhile enemy as if they were schoolmates at Harrow. Yet Churchill, born into a privileged family, was not an uncritical supporter of the Victorian status quo. He himself loathed Harrow; an especially amusing chapter skewers the school's emphasis on an irrelevant classical education and rote learning. A firm Tory, he considered himself a friend of the working class, and in 1899 campaigned for parliament with a Socialist colleague. Looking back from his vantage point of 1930, Churchill expresses the most attractive values of the English aristocracy--honor, loyalty, fair play--without giving the impression he wants to live in the past. The book's appeal also stems from its magisterial but colloquial prose. Anyone familiar with recordings of Churchill's rousing speeches during Word War II will hear in their minds' ears that growling timbre and unmistakably patrician accent as they read. Though he would have preferred the peace prize, <i>My Early Life</i> offers good evidence that Churchill's 1953 Nobel for literature was aptly awarded. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>This is the story of the first twenty-five years of Mr. Churchill&#39;s life, up to the point where his unique parliamentary career was just beginning. From childhood and his apprentice days at Harrow and Sandhurst we follow him on active service to Cuba, the North West Frontier, Omdurman and the Boer War (including the historic story of his escape from captivity), whilst in the background are his early adventures in politics and literature.</p><h2>NKJV, Spirit-Filled Life Bible, Third Edition, Genuine Leather, Black, Red Letter, Comfort Print: Kingdom Equipping Through the Power of the Word</h2><p><p>Encounter the power of the word.

Fasten your seat belt and get ready for every Mustang worth hearing about.</b><br><br> In the early 1960s, Lee Iacocca--then director of the Ford division at Ford Motor Company--convinced Henry Ford II to produce a sporty four-seat car aimed at the emerging youth market. That car, essentially a reconfigured and re-skinned <b>Falcon </b>economy car, became the <b>Ford Mustang</b>, and it changed the automotive world like <b>no other car before or since</b>.<br><br> In <i>Ford Mustang: America's Original Pony Car</i>, acclaimed Mustang writer Donald Farr celebrates this unbroken lineage of muscle. He chronicles the car's <b>phenomenal first-year sales</b>, the new <b>pony car category</b> it pioneered, and subsequent models that include the <b>Mustang GT</b>, <b>Shelby GT350</b>, <b>Shelby GT500</b>, <b>Super Cobra Jet</b>, <b>Boss 302</b>, and <b>Boss 429</b> -&nbsp;all part of a line of American performance cars that continues to this day.<br><br> Created <b>in cooperation with Ford Motor Company</b> and featuring some <b>400 photos</b> from its historic and media archives, <i>Ford Mustang</i> is a must on the bookshelf of any muscle car or Ford aficionado.</p></p><p><p>As editor of <i>Mustang Monthly</i> magazine, <b>Donald Farr</b> has been researching and writing about Mustangs for over 30 years.

A graduate of Babson College and Harvard Business School, he is currently a member of the Ford Motor Company board of directors.</p><p>"Donald Farr, a longtime writer and editor at Mustang-centric publications, provides a comprehensive recounting of the car's gestation as a design study in the early 1960s, its splashy debut at the 1964 New York World's Fair and its tumultuous life up through the fifth-generation model that is entering its final model year. The book concludes with sections on Mustangs for racing, in pop culture and for hobbyists and collectors.While not exactly a beach read, the book is more digestible, even for general audiences, than its dauntingly encyclopedic appearance might suggest. The captions for the many interesting photos are even more compelling." - <b><i>The New York Times</i></b><i></i></p><br><br><p>"This is not a book you will read in one or two sittings and put on the shelf.

Why did rural Americans vote overwhelmingly for Donald Trump? And is there a more nuanced explanation for the growing rural-urban divide? Drawing on more than a decade of research and hundreds of interviews, Robert Wuthnow brings us into America&#x2019;s small towns, farms, and rural communities to paint a rich portrait of the moral order&#x2015;the interactions, loyalties, obligations, and identities&#x2015;underpinning this critical segment of the nation. Wuthnow demonstrates that to truly understand rural Americans&#x2019; anger, their culture must be explored more fully, and he shows that rural America&#x2019;s fury stems less from economic concerns than from the perception that Washington is distant from and yet threatening to the social fabric of small towns. Moving beyond simplistic depictions of America&#x2019;s heartland, <i>The Left Behind</i> offers a clearer picture of how this important population will influence the nation&#x2019;s political future.</p></p><p><p> "Wuthnow cogently confronts the question: Why are so many of the people living in small-town America filled with rage? Instead of condemning, he listens. In this highly accessible, instructive book, Wuthnow reminds readers why the so-called American Dream is closely connected to the politics of place."<b>--Nancy Isenberg, author of <i>White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America</i></b></p><p> "Analytical and humane, this account of the dense, vexed moral communities of rural America is based on profound fieldwork conducted over the course of a decade by one of our most accomplished sociologists. Conveying the anxieties and resentments that run deep in stressed but resilient small-town America, Wuthnow's appraisal of ethical sensibilities, patterns and limits of membership, and political orientations is learned, engrossing, and timely."<b>--Ira Katznelson, author of <i>Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time</i></b></p><p> "Distilling an impressive body of research, this book describes the core characteristics of rural moral communities and brings important conceptualizations of rural life to audiences that may not have previously encountered them. Given the contemporary political environment, <i>The Left Behind</i> is a timely contribution."<b>--Colin Jerolmack, New York University</b></p><p> "Wuthnow draws on his trove of primary source interviews and observations in small-town America, and a wealth of other materials, to effectively describe how the social fabric and moral tenors of small towns are changing. This thoughtful and effective book serves as a corrective to the caricatures of small-town America and is an important resource for our shared future."<b>--Courtney Bender, Columbia University</b></p><b>Robert Wuthnow</b> is the Gerhard R.

We were going to read them at the We Love Nature assembly on Monday in the auditorium. Frankie and Ashley wrote theirs right away. They never have a problem at school in any subject. I have a problem with every subject. I&#x2019;m bad at reading, spelling, math, and science. But I&#x2019;m great at lunch.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night before I had sat at my desk forever, staring at a blank piece of paper. There wasn&#x2019;t a poem in my head or anywhere else in my body. So this morning my mom suggested that we all <br> go to the park after school. She said that maybe looking at the flowers and trees would help me come up with an idea.<br> &nbsp;<br> But it wasn&#x2019;t working.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hank, you can&#x2019;t just give up,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;You have an assignment to write a poem. Quitting is not a choice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, Mom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try one more time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look around you and enjoy nature,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Something <br> will come to you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I concentrated on some bright purple flowers. They were just starting to bloom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ve got the first lines for a poem,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Ashley, would you please write these down when I say them?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ashley took a pencil from behind her ear and pulled out her little spiral notebook that was covered in rhinestones.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready. Let it rip.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I cleared my throat and began:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Oh pretty flowers so bright and purple&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>I love your smell, it is so gurple.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When I got to the end, I noticed that Ashley had stopped writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to hand it to you, Zip,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;&#x2018;Purple&#x2019; is the only other word I can think of that doesn&#x2019;t rhyme with anything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about &#x2018;<i>gurple</i>&#x2019;?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That rhymes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not a word,&#x201d; Ashley said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I sighed loudly. This was just too frustrating.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think the problem, honey,&#x201d; my mom said, &#x201c;is that you&#x2019;re not inspired. Do you know what &#x2018;inspired&#x2019; means?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do,&#x201d; Ashley said. &#x201c;It means you&#x2019;re full of thoughts and ideas, and they just come pouring out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How am I supposed to get inspired about some purple flowers?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think we need to take you out into <i>real </i>nature,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;I know a beautiful campsite a few hours north of the city called Harmony Acres. I&#x2019;ll bet you could write a poem there. Maybe we could go this weekend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cool! Could we sleep over?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;In a tent and everything? Can Frankie and Ashley come?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Ashley said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my grandmother&#x2019;s birthday this weekend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;d love to come, if it&#x2019;s okay with my parents,&#x201d; Frankie said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have to talk to Hank&#x2019;s dad,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;If he says yes, we&#x2019;ll leave Saturday morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go talk to Dad,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;This is going to be great.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We jumped up and hurried home. My dad was sitting at the dining-room table staring at his computer. He works at home. There&#x2019;s a desk in the bedroom where he&#x2019;s supposed to work, but he says he thinks better when he&#x2019;s dipping pretzels in sour cream. Mom doesn&#x2019;t like pretzel crumbs all over the bedroom rug, so he spends a lot of time in the dining room.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dad! Dad!&#x201d; I said as I raced in. &#x201c;We want to go on a family camping trip!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have a wonderful time, Hank. I can&#x2019;t wait to hear all the details. I&#x2019;ll be right here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Dad! The whole family is going. That means you, too!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad looked over at my mom. He didn&#x2019;t look happy.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whose idea was this?&#x201d; he asked her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, Hank needs to write a nature poem by Monday,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And I thought that being out in nature would inspire him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to drive all the way upstate to write a poem,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I need to smell the trees to be inspired,&#x201d; I told him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nonsense, Hank. I can write a poem without getting up from this table.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He took one of his mechanical pencils out of his pocket protector. He always has three pencils lined up in a row, in case one of them runs out of lead. He stared at it for a second and made up a poem on the spot.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;A pencil like this sure comes in handy.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> But don&#x2019;t you eat it like cotton candy.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Use it to write your ABC&#x2019;s.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Then write your poem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who needs trees?&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wow, Dad!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s terrific. You&#x2019;re a poet and you didn&#x2019;t even know it!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You see, Hank? Who needs camping?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My sister, Emily, wandered in. As usual, she was carrying her pet iguana, Katherine, around her neck like a scarf.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did I hear the word &#x2018;camping&#x2019;?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Katherine doesn&#x2019;t like to camp out. Sleeping bags make her scales itch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For the first time ever, I agree with Katherine,&#x201d; my dad said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But, Dad,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t have scales. At least not that I can see.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was talking about camping,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a city guy. I need pavement under my feet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mom put her hand on his shoulder. &#x201c;This is just for one night, Stan. We&#x2019;ll sleep under the stars and sit around the fire and tell stories.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And swat bugs,&#x201d; my dad added.<br> &nbsp;<br> I took a deep breath. &#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; I began, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re always telling me that I don&#x2019;t do well in school.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t try hard enough, Hank.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And also because you put pencils in your ears instead of listening to the teacher,&#x201d; Emily chimed in.<br> &nbsp;<br> Katherine shot her tongue out at me and started to hiss. She always takes Emily&#x2019;s side.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Emily,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;Please let Hank finish. You too, Katherine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want to try harder,&#x201d; I said to my dad. &#x201c;And here is a chance for me to finally do well. Think about it. We&#x2019;re at the We Love Nature assembly on Monday. I stand up to read my poem. It&#x2019;s great, and the crowd goes wild. My teacher gives me an A. And you were part of it, because you said yes to camping.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone was quiet for a minute. I think they were impressed with my speech. To be honest, I was, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> My dad took off his glasses and put them in his shirt pocket. He stared at me for what seemed like a month and a half.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but don&#x2019;t hold your breath.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That wasn&#x2019;t exactly a yes. But it wasn&#x2019;t exactly a no, either.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Four Reasons I Gave My Dad for Why We Should All Go Camping<br> &nbsp;<br> 1.

Connell illumines the rare but supremely brilliant leadership of the first and only unanimously elected President of the United States. George Washington, modest yet elegant, handsome, always projecting strength, graciousness and power, was universally considered the most humble man who ever lived. Born into modest circumstances, he wholeheartedly responded to whatever opportunities life offered him. Self-taught Washington was no stranger to sorrow, cold, hunger, persecution, violence, or terrorism, yet he was at home not only in the wilds of the frontier, but equally so in the finest salons of the times. His singular accomplishment was to face misfortune and conquer it. This greatest of all American heroes achieved startling victory by discipline, commitment, prayer, and the graced ability to bend his will under the yoke of what he called &#x201c;Kind Providence&#x201d;. With precision and detail in a rare look at his extraordinary leadership through the prism of George Washington&#x2019;s interior depths, the author briefly examines: - his boyhood scarred by the early death of his father, - -his life as a young surveyor on the dangerous frontier, - his heroics as a militia leader in the French and Indian War, - his place at the Continental Congress, - his unwanted assignment as Commander-in Chief during the Revolutionary War, - his desolation at Valley Forge, - his silent triumph at the Constitutional Convention, - his simplicity during the heights of his presidency, - his mystical premonitions during his retirement at Mount Vernon - his spiritual and religious circumstances surrounding his sudden death in the darkness of mid-December, 1799. Held in the highest regard by his fellow citizens, history has canonized George Washington as the most esteemed of the Founding Fathers. At the root of that esteem was his deeply private spirituality. The Spiritual Journey of George Washington includes the full text of Washington&#x2019;s personal prayers (some possibly composed by Washington himself) and Jesuit inspired Rules of Civility by which George Washington conducted himself personally. It also includes the Declaration of Independence by which George Washington became the military leader responsible for carving out a new nation.The book reveals insights concerning military, political and social victories Washington achieved through sincere, humble leadership he perfected using his Bible as a guideline for just behavior in peace and war. Washington went about feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing and sheltering the needy, visiting the imprisoned, caring for the sick and burying the dead. As General George Washington counseled, instructed, admonished, fought, forgave and prayed for others, he forged a path of national opportunity for American citizens to acquire undreamed of prosperity and abundance. In contemporary times wracked by wars, terrorism, disease, starvation, confusion and tyranny, The Spiritual Journey of George Washington has wisdom for everyone of good will. Washington&#x2019;s accomplishments and writings disclose that &#x201c;Kind Providence&#x201d; truly was in him, around him, and always with him. The book contains excerpts of Washington's Farewell Address that continues to guide Americans more than two hundred years later. The nurturing light of George Washington&#x2019;s spirituality is his finest bequest to all people who seek life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p>Janice T.

The fact that Carol was about to become a mother shouldn&#x2019;t have come as a shock&#x2014;her sister and Jason had been married for two years, after all. Lauren loved her sister, and Jason would make a wonderful father. What bothered her was the fact that at age thirty-four, Lauren was still unmarried.<br><br>Single. Oh, how she&#x2019;d come to hate that word.<br><br>Walking down Blossom Street, Lauren buried her hands deep into the pockets of her fawn-colored rain jacket. Tulips and crocuses bloomed in the flowerpots that hung from the streetlights, and the scent of roses, lilacs, and camellias followed her as she walked past Susannah&#x2019;s Garden, the flower shop.<br><br>Lauren kept her head down as she mulled over this latest development. This was it. The end of her rope. The line in the sand. She was finished waiting for Todd to give her an engagement ring. A year earlier she&#x2019;d had the DTR&#x2014;Defining the Relationship&#x2014;talk with Todd and he&#x2019;d assured her that marriage was definitely part of their future. Only he wasn&#x2019;t in a financial position to make the leap just yet. He&#x2019;d suggested they give it time, and she&#x2019;d reluctantly agreed. That was twelve months ago, and frankly her patience was shot. She&#x2019;d dated the popular local television newscaster for three years and it was time to own up to the truth. If Todd was sincere about wanting her for his wife, then she would have had a diamond on her ring finger long before now.<br><br>Clearly Todd enjoyed their relationship just the way it was, and in some ways so did she. Todd was fun and smart, and she liked being with him. Because of his job, Lauren frequently accompanied him to high-profile social events. As a result, she was able to mingle with some of the city&#x2019;s elite, and it didn&#x2019;t hurt that many of these socialites came to John Michael Jewelers, where she worked, for their jewelry needs.<br><br>Lauren passed A Good Yarn and the window display instantly caught her attention. She stopped to give it a look and shook her head. Wouldn&#x2019;t you know it, the display in the yarn store&#x2019;s window was a baby blanket.<br><br>A beautiful baby blanket knit in lovely pastel colors. Lauren wanted to groan. She loved her sister, but there&#x2019;d always been a friendly rivalry between them. More laid-back of the two, Lauren didn&#x2019;t have big career ambitions, whereas Carol worked as a program designer for a large software company out of California. She&#x2019;d married her college sweetheart and seemed to have the perfect life.<br><br>Lauren had dropped out of college after a couple of years and over time had worked at a number of jobs. She enjoyed sales and seemed to be good at it. The irony was that her specialty was engagement and wedding bands. The couples she dealt with were deeply in love and eager to start their lives together. It gave Lauren a deep sense of satisfaction to help them take one of their first steps toward commitment.<br><br>The bottom line, she realized now, was that Todd was completely content to leave matters just as they were. They got along great and talked frequently. Rarely a week passed without them attending some sort of social event. They would like to spend more time together, but Todd was busy with his broadcasting career. He had his sights set on getting an anchor position and focused most of his attention on achieving his professional goals.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Lauren,&#x201d; Lydia Hoffman said, coming up from behind her.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hi.&#x201d; Lauren spun around to greet the owner of the yarn store. Lydia&#x2019;s husband, Brad, had purchased his wife&#x2019;s wedding band at John Michael Jewelers, where Lauren had worked for the past five years.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that a beautiful baby blanket?&#x201d; Lydia asked, apparently noticing that Lauren&#x2019;s gaze was focused on the window display.<br><br>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; Lauren had no option but to agree.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ve sold more yarn from this display than any I&#x2019;ve ever done. There&#x2019;s something about knitting for babies that draws people into the shop. Just yesterday a customer stopped by and bought yarn for the blanket and told me she doesn&#x2019;t know anyone who&#x2019;s having a baby, but she thought she&#x2019;d knit it anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>Lauren faked a smile. &#x201c;I just got word my sister is pregnant.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t elaborate and explain that Carol was a full two years younger than she. &#x201c;When I saw this blanket I thought I should knit it for her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d treasure it. Anything homemade makes a baby gift all the more special.&#x201d;<br><br>Lydia inserted the key to the front door, and while Lauren was tempted to purchase the yarn right then, she needed to get to work herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be by later today or tomorrow to pick up the yarn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make it Thursday. I&#x2019;m sold out, but I have a new shipment due in then. I&#x2019;ll be here if you need any help with the pattern,&#x201d; Lydia assured her.<br><br>John Michael Jewelers was one block down from the yarn store. Elisa Lippincott, the original owner&#x2019;s daughter, managed the store now with her husband, Garry. Lauren enjoyed her job immensely and considered Elisa a friend as well as her employer.<br><br>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; Lauren said as she came into the store. She locked the door behind her. When the safe was open all the doors leading into the store remained locked.<br><br>Elisa stuck her head out of the walk-in safe. &#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; she returned brightly. She had a pair of jewel cases in her hands, which she set into the display window that looked out onto Blossom Street.<br><br>Lauren removed her raincoat and stuck it in the back office along with her purse. Right away she helped Elisa get out the precious stones. Despite the down economy, the store continued to do well. Elisa, Garry, and Lauren&#x2014;all working full-time, along with a few part-time sales associates&#x2014;were a good team.<br><br>&#x201c;Garry will be in sometime this afternoon,&#x201d; Elisa explained as she set out the semiprecious stones. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a meeting at the school for one of the boys, and then he&#x2019;s headed to lunch with the Rotary Club.&#x201d;<br><br>Garry was the company expert when it came to men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s watches. Lauren headed up their diamond sales, and Elisa handled just about everything else.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard from my sister,&#x201d; Lauren said casually as she set the jewels in the display case, locking them inside. &#x201c;Carol and Jason are pregnant.&#x201d; She made sure she sounded pleased and excited for her younger sibling.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Lauren agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just wonderful. Mom and Dad are over the moon. Their first grandchild.&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa paused and focused her attention on Lauren. &#x201c;You sound like you&#x2019;re ready to cry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could break into sobs at the drop of a pin,&#x201d; she admitted, and tried to laugh it off, but the only sound that came out was reminiscent of something one might hear on the Sci-Fi channel. She quickly got hold of herself. &#x201c;Tell me, Elisa, and please be honest. Is there something wrong with me?&#x201d; Because Elisa was her friend, she expected the truth.<br><br>&#x201c;Wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Am I annoying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; Elisa sounded shocked that Lauren would suggest such a thing.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have a domineering or unpleasant personality?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I bore you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Her friend shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Am I unattractive?&#x201d;<br><br>This question produced a laugh. &#x201c;Hardly. Have you looked in a mirror lately? You&#x2019;re gorgeous&#x2014;tall and slim, with your stunning blue eyes and that dark hair. I swear there must be some Scottish blood in you somewhere. Half the men who come in this shop leave half in love with you.&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend&#x2019;s words were a balm to her wounded pride. &#x201c;Then why am I still single?&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Because Todd Hampton is an idiot.&#x201d; She gently squeezed Lauren&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been much too patient with him. You need to give Todd an ultimatum,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;He loves you. All he needs now is a gentle shove in the right direction. Tell him it&#x2019;s time; you&#x2019;ve been patient to this point, but you aren&#x2019;t willing to continue without a firm commitment.&#x201d;<br><br>An ultimatum for Todd&#x2014;Lauren had reached the same conclusion but then rethought the matter. The fact was, she&#x2019;d spent the majority of the night tossing and turning, mulling over her options with Todd. She&#x2019;d teetered back and forth with the relationship, wondering what would be best. She hated the idea of forcing him to set a date, and then wondered why she&#x2019;d been so willing to let matters drag.<br><br>&#x201c;The thing is . . .&#x201d; Lauren didn&#x2019;t get the opportunity to finish her sentence when Elisa&#x2019;s cellphone chirped.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Katie.&#x201d; Elisa grabbed it before the second chirp.<br><br>Lauren knew the shop owner had been anxiously awaiting a call from her oldest child. Katie was a college freshman, and Elisa had undergone separation anxiety sending her only daughter away to school, which was less than three hundred miles away in Pullman, Washington. Elisa worried incessantly over Katie&#x2019;s diet, studies, partying, alcohol, and dating. If Katie didn&#x2019;t contact her mother at some point during the day, Elisa was convinced her child had fallen victim to any number of dreadful possibilities.<br><br>&#x201c;Katie, why haven&#x2019;t you called?&#x201d; Elisa demanded. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t answer the text message I sent, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa paused, then let out a loud gasp and hurried into the small office, quickly closing the door. Lauren couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what that was about. Her friend tended to be something of a drama queen. Even with the office door closed, Lauren could hear Elisa, although she couldn&#x2019;t make out what she was saying.<br><br>The possibilities raced through Lauren&#x2019;s mind. More than likely, it was something minor. Katie might have flunked an important test. More likely, she needed extra money put into her bank account. Quite possibly, she hadn&#x2019;t turned in her library books on time and had allowed the fine to accumulate. Lauren liked Katie and considered the teenager levelheaded and responsible. As a friend and employer, Elisa was great, but as a mother, she was a bit fixated.<br><br>Ten minutes later, Elisa reappeared, as white as a sun-bleached sheet.<br><br>&#x201c;Elisa,&#x201d; Lauren asked tentatively. &#x201c;Is everything all right with Katie?&#x201d;<br><br>Her friend didn&#x2019;t answer and then simply shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you need to sit down?&#x201d;<br><br>Elisa nodded.<br><br>Lauren scooted over a stool, and Elisa sank onto it in slow motion.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want me to call Garry?&#x201d;<br><br>That got an immediate response that came as a shout: &#x201c;No . . . no!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I get you coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need something way stronger than coffee. Way stronger.&#x201d;<br><br>Lauren didn&#x2019;t think they kept anything more potent at the store, unless it was for a special sales event. Even then it was champagne, and Lauren suspected Elisa wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to celebrate with a glass of bubbly. &#x201c;Can you tell me what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Tears welled in Elisa&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Apparently, this was something far worse than an overdue library book or a failed test. Disregarding what Elisa had claimed she needed, Lauren brewed her a single cup of coffee, making sure it was extra-strong. She added three cubes of sugar and stirred until it had dissolved before delivering it to her friend.<br><br>Elisa held on to the cup with both hands as though it was all that was keeping her from falling off the edge of a ten-story building. &#x201c;Do you remember Dietrich?&#x201d;</p><h2>Broadway Presents!

Hong challenges the conventional depiction of parents and teachers as &#x201c;natural enemies,&#x201d; and shows how, through teachers&#x2019; initiative and commitment, they can become natural allies instead.<br><br> Based on a three-year ethnographic study, the book features the experiences and motivations of five urban school teachers who have successfully created meaningful, productive relationships and partnerships with students&#x2019; families. In <i>Natural Allies</i>, the teachers&#x2019; personal narratives are juxtaposed with rich descriptions of their interactions with families and children. The book explores how the dimensions of race, class, culture, and family history shape the interactions between teachers and families, particularly in schools where teacher-parent dynamics may be fraught with distrust or misunderstanding.<br><br> The book demonstrates how commitment to families and community can become a central part of educators&#x2019; development as professionals. In addition, the research provides new insight and seeks to merge the study of family engagement with the field of culturally relevant and sustaining pedagogies.<br><br> Offered with optimism and urgency, <i>Natural Allies</i> addresses an area in which many educators feel ill equipped and unprepared. Readers will emerge from a reading of the book with new ideas on family engagement that are grounded in an analysis of the deep contours of the parent-teacher relationship.</p><p><b>Soo Hong</b> is an associate professor and chair&nbsp;of education at Wellesley College.</p><h2>Barron&#39;s Police Officer Exam, 10th Edition (Barron&#39;s Test Prep)</h2><p><b>Rated "Best of the Best" in Police Exam Prep Books by BestReviews, September 2018</b><br><br><b>This updated manual presents information, practice tests, and strategies for the different question types used by police departments throughout the country.</b> It includes:<br><ul><li>Four full-length practice exams with all questions answered and explained</li><li>Two official exams given by a large metropolitan police department</li><li>Streamlining of chapters to more closely reflect the latest question types currently in use</li><li>General strategies for dealing with multiple-choice questions and specific strategies for taking computer-based multiple-choice tests, as well as for taking the traditional paper/pencil multiple-choice exam</li><li>All important time management strategies</li><li>New reading comprehension question types, plus strategies for answering these questions</li></ul><br>An additional diagnostic exam presents questions like those that have appeared on recent entry-level exams used by police departments across the country.

But the shabby home of an elderly widow holds alarming surprises: street drugs in the silverware drawer, a trunkful of jewels in the attic, and the distinctive ring Audrey&#x2019;s mother was wearing the night she disappeared. Believing the truth will bring her peace, Audrey relentlessly pursues clues to her family&#x2019;s troubled history. But each fact Audrey uncovers drags her further away from the love she craves, and puts her on a collision course with people more determined, more ambitious, and more dangerous than she can fathom. Ultimately, some truths are too awful to bear, and too terrible to share. Fans of Liane Moriarty and Melinda Leigh will enjoy this funny mystery full of antiques, romance, suspense and a lovable shelter dog named Ethel.

He lives in Los Angeles.1<br>They called me to view the body on a wet spring morning when darkness webbed my house. Some nights are like that; more now than before. Picture the World&#x2019;s Greatest Detective, reluctant subject of sidebar articles in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>Los Angeles </i>magazine, stretched on his couch in a redwood A-frame overlooking the city, not really sleeping at 3:58 A.M. when the phone rang. I thought it was a reporter, but answered anyway. <br><br>&#x201c;Hello.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;This is Detective Kelly Diaz with LAPD. I apologize about the time, but I&#x2019;m trying to reach Elvis Cole.&#x201d; <br><br>Her voice was coarse, reflecting the early hour. I pushed into a sitting position and cleared my throat. Police who call before sunrise have nothing to offer but bad news. <br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you get my number?&#x201d; <br><br>I had changed my home number when the news stories broke, but reporters and cranks still called. <br><br>&#x201c;One of the criminalists had it or got it, I&#x2019;m not sure. Either way, I&#x2019;m sorry for calling like this, but we have a homicide. We have reason to believe you know the deceased.&#x201d; <br><br>Something sharp stabbed behind my eyes, and I swung my feet to the floor. <br><br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like you to come down here, see for yourself. We&#x2019;re downtown near Twelfth and Hill Street. I can send a radio car if that would help.&#x201d; <br><br>The house was dark. Sliding glass doors opened to a deck that jutted like a diving platform over the canyon behind my house. The lights on the opposite ridge were murky with the low clouds and mist. I cleared my throat again. <br><br>&#x201c;Is it Joe Pike?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pike&#x2019;s your partner, right? The ex-cop with the sunglasses?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He has arrows tattooed on the outside of his delts. They&#x2019;re red.&#x201d; <br><br>She covered the phone, but I heard muffled voices. She was asking. My chest filled with a growing pressure, and I didn&#x2019;t like that she had to ask because asking meant maybe it was. <br><br>&#x201c;Is it Pike?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, this isn&#x2019;t Pike. This man has tattoos, but not like that. I&#x2019;m sorry if I scared you that way. Listen, we can send a car.&#x201d; <br><br>I closed my eyes, letting the pressure fade. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything about it. What makes you think I know?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The victim said some things before he died. Come down and take a look. I&#x2019;ll send a car.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Am I a suspect?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Nothing like that. We just want to see if you can help with the ID.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What was your name?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Diaz&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Diaz&#x2013;it&#x2019;s four in the morning, I haven&#x2019;t slept in two months, and I&#x2019;m not in the mood. If you think I know this guy, then you think I&#x2019;m a suspect. Everyone who knows a homicide victim is a suspect until they&#x2019;re cleared, so just tell me who you got and ask whatever it is you want to ask.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What it is, we have a deceased Anglo male we believe to be the victim of a robbery. They got his wallet, so I can&#x2019;t give you a name. We&#x2019;re hoping you can help with that part. Here, listen&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you think I know him?&#x201d; <br><br>She plowed on with the description as if I hadn&#x2019;t spoken. <br><br>&#x201c;Anglo male, dyed black hair thin on top, brown eyes, approximately seventy years but he could be older, I guess, and he has crucifix tattoos on both palms.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Why do you think I know him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He has more tats of a religious nature on his arms&#x2013;Jesus, the Virgin, things like that. None of this sounds familiar?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any idea who you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What we have is a deceased male as I&#x2019;ve described, one gunshot to the chest. By his appearance and location, he appears indigent, but we&#x2019;re working on that. I&#x2019;m the officer who found him. He was still conscious at that time and said things that suggested you would recognize his description.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Look, Cole, I&#x2019;m not trying to be difficult. It would be better if&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; <br><br>Diaz didn&#x2019;t answer right away. <br><br>&#x201c;He told me he was your father.&#x201d; <br><br>I sat without moving in my dark house. I had started that night in bed, but ended on the couch, hoping the steady patter of rain would quiet my heart, but sleep had not come. <br><br>&#x201c;Just like that, he told you he was my father.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I tried to get a statement, but all he said was something about you being his son, and then he passed. You&#x2019;re the same Elvis Cole they wrote the stories about, aren&#x2019;t you? In the <i>Times</i>?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;He had the clippings. I figured you would recognize the tats if you knew him, me thinking he was your father, but it sounds like you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>My voice came out hoarse, and the catch embarrassed me. <br><br>&#x201c;I never met my father. I don&#x2019;t know anything about him, and as far as I know he doesn&#x2019;t know me.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We want you to come take a look, Mr. Cole. We have a few questions.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I thought I wasn&#x2019;t a suspect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At this time, you aren&#x2019;t, but we still have the questions. We sent a radio car. It should be pulling up just about now.&#x201d; <br><br>Approaching headlights brightened my kitchen as she said it. I heard the car roll to a slow stop outside my house, and more light filled my front entry. They had radioed their status, and someone with Diaz had signaled their arrival. <br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Diaz, tell them to shut their lights. No point in waking the neighbors.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The car is a courtesy, Mr. Cole. In case you were unable to drive after you saw him.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Sure. That&#x2019;s why you kept offering the car like it was my choice even though it was already coming.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still your choice. If you want to take your own car you can follow them. We just have a few questions.&#x201d; <br><br>The glow outside vanished, and once more my home was in darkness. <br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Diaz, I&#x2019;m coming. Tell them to take it easy out there. I have to get dressed. <br><br>&#x201c;Not a problem. We&#x2019;ll see you in a few minutes.&#x201d; <br><br>I put down the phone but still did not move. I had not moved in hours. Outside, a light rain fell as quietly as a whisper. I must have been waiting for Diaz to call. Why else would I have been awake that night and all the other nights except to wait like a lost child in the woods, a forgotten child waiting to be found? <br><br>After a while I dressed, then followed the radio car to see the dead.</p><h2>To Men of Earth: Valiant Thor&#39;s Message of Hope to Mankind</h2><p>Never has there been anything quite like it.

The real wage of a US worker today is less than it was 40 years ago&#x2014;but there are four times as many multimillionaires. As inequality grows, the politics become more poisonous. Every year, more and more Americans go on shooting sprees, killing strangers and passers-by&#x2014;and now, increasingly, representatives of the state. Troubling trends of this kind are endlessly discussed by public intellectuals and social scientists. But mostly, they talk about only a small slice of the overall problem. After all, how on earth can yet another murderous rampage have anything to do with polarization in Congress? And is there really a connection between too many multimillionaires and government gridlock? Historical analysis shows that long spells of equitable prosperity and internal peace are succeeded by protracted periods of inequity, increasing misery, and political instability. These crisis periods&#x2014;&#x201c;Ages of Discord&#x201d;&#x2014;have recurred in societies throughout history. Modern Americans may be disconcerted to learn that the US right now has much in common with the Antebellum 1850s and, more surprisingly, with ancien r�gime France on the eve of the French Revolution. Can it really be true that there is nothing new about our troubled time, and that similar ages arise periodically for similar underlying reasons? Ages of Discord marshals Structural-Demograpic Theory and detailed historical data to show that this is, indeed, the case. The book takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride through American history, from the Era of Good Feelings of the 1820s to our first Age of Discord, which culminated in the American Civil War, to post-WW2 prosperity and, finally, to our present, second Age of Discord.</p><p>Visit peterturchin.com/ages-of-discord/ for sample chapters and supporting online materialsPeter Turchin is an evolutionary anthropologist and one of the founders of the new field of historical social science, Cliodynamics.

The Halloween basics--haunted houses, bats, ghosts, candy, costumes--are all represented in this fluffy little gift book for the very young goblin. (Preschool) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Mark Rothko: Notecard Boxes -- a stationery box filled with 20 Notecards perfect for Greetings, Birthdays or Invitations</h2><p>~ <strong>20 envelopes</strong> &amp; <strong>20 notecards</strong>, 5 each of <strong>4 images</strong><br><br>~ Sturdy &amp; reuseable box <br><br>~ Great for storage<br>Our line of stationery notecard boxes suits every taste and is appropriate to give on any occasion.

How are apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers going to rise up and work together? Where do small group meetings fit? Will the Church come together in unity? How does the anointing of God work and what is your role? This book puts into words what you have been sensing in your spirit. (Eberle&#39;s best seller, translated in many languages, distributed worldwide.)</p><p>The words of our Lord: <p> &#x201c;And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins? (Luke 5:37-38) Whenever the Holy Spirit fills people with &#x201c;new wine,&#x201d; the structure or organization in which they function must change. Old wineskins rip. New wineskins must be used to hold the additional life and power of God. </p><p> We have seen this principle in operation throughout the history of the Church. When Martin Luther received revelation from the Holy Spirit concerning faith and grace, the established church in that day was ripped in two and a new denomination under Luther was born. When John Wesley preached with the fire of the Spirit, a new structure, now known as the Methodist denomination, had to be formed. The same process has occurred again and again as great men or women ministered under a fresh anointing of God&#x2019;s Spirit. And, of course, we had seen how thousands of churches have formed over the last fifty years as members received a baptism of the Holy Spirit with various manifestations. A new wineskin formed each time new wine was poured in. </p><p> God is pouring new wine into us. Christians all over the world have been crying out to God for a fresh outpouring of His Spirit. Our Lord has never failed His Church. Repeatedly, He has brought powerful spiritual awakenings. Many believe that the last outpouring of God&#x2019;s Spirit that is promised in the Bible (Joel 2:28-29) will soon take place. The time for God to move is at hand. </p><p> Therefore, we should expect our present wineskins to rip. Jesus taught that it is impossible to pour new wine into an old wineskin without ripping it. There can be no mighty spiritual awakening in our day without a great shaking of our Church organizations, leaders, and structures. If you are looking for the Second Coming of Jesus, or if you are praying to God to move upon your church, your city, your local schools, your family, or your own heart, then the first thing you must look for is a new wineskin. </p><p> How will the present wineskin of the Church be changed? We cannot expect to know the same power to f the Holy Spirit that the New Testament believers experienced unless we have wineskins similar to theirs. One of the major changes will have to do with the full operation of what we call the five ministry gifts: apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher (Eph. 4:11). </p><p> Many Christians have thought that the apostle and prophet were only for the New Testament times, but that is wrong. Ephesians 4:11-13 tells us that all five of these gifts were given by God to the Church &#x201c;until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.&#x201d; The Church will never reach its fullness nor any form of unity until all five ministry gifts are functioning together in the Body of Christ. </p><p> Today, God is raising up leaders who have these gifts. The Church is now undergoing a major reformation in its structure that will enable it to handle a great outpouring of God&#x2019;s Spirit. </p><p> This is the reason I have written this book. I want to share with you some of the ways the present organization of the Church is ripping and the new wineskin is being formed. We will look first at the ministry gifts and at other leadership positions are to work in unity and power. </p><p> Throughout the book I have used the capitalized word Church to refer to the whole Body of Christ, which is made up of all those throughout the world who believe in Jesus. The word church, with lower case &#x201c;c,&#x201d; will refer to any local group of Christians who gather regularly for prayer, fellowship, worship and teaching.</p>Winepress Ministries was founded by Harold Eberle, who after pastoring a church in the northwestern United States, began traveling to minister at leadership conferences, Christian gatherings, and churches of many different doctrinal persuasions. He now is engaged in a worldwide teaching ministry, equipping saints for greater effectiveness in the Kingdom of God. He lives in Yakima, Washington, with his wife, Linda, and their three children. Yakima also serves as home base for their ministry operations, which includes the oversight of Winepress Publishing. <p>This is a ministry directed towards the success and maturation of the Church. It is based on a conviction Harold has concerning the Church rising to a position of unity and glory before the end of the age. We believe that God is now bringing the Church into a reformation. This is demanding great changes in the way we think, minister and live. </p><p>Winepress Ministries functions to help the Church make those changes. God has and is opening up tremendous doors for us to influence the Body of Christ. It is our goal to fulfill our role in the maturation of the Church. </p><p>Presently we are not only publishing materials, but also building relationships with "Apostolic Leaders" in different countries of the world. It is our goal to work with leaders of our nation and in foreign countries, influencing them and the large number of believers under their oversight. We train up leaders, speak revelation, teach, impart strength and raise the church to a higher level of maturity.</p></p><h2>NPCs (Spells, Swords, Stealth)</h2><p>What happens when the haggling is done and the shops are closed? When the quest has been given, the steeds saddled, and the adventurers are off to their next encounter? They keep the world running, the food cooked, and the horses shoed, yet what adventurer has ever spared a thought or concern for the Non-Player Characters? In the town of Maplebark, four such NPCs settle in for a night of actively ignoring the adventurers drinking in the tavern when things go quickly and fatally awry. Once the dust settles, these four find themselves faced with an impossible choice: pretend to be adventurers undertaking a task of near-certain death or see their town and loved ones destroyed. Armed only with salvaged equipment, second-hand knowledge, and a secret that could get them killed, it will take all manner of miracles if they hope to pull off their charade. And even if they succeed, the deadliest part of their journey may well be what awaits them at its end.</p><p>Drew Hayes graduated from Texas Tech with a degree in English.

In his controversial study of America's giving habits, Arthur C. Brooks shatters stereotypes about charity in America-including the myth that the political Left is more compassionate than the Right. Brooks, a preeminent public policy expert, spent years researching giving trends in America, and even he was surprised by what he found. In <i>Who Really Cares</i>, he identifies the forces behind American charity: strong families, church attendance, earning one's own income (as opposed to receiving welfare), and the belief that individuals-not government-offer the best solution to social ills. But beyond just showing us who the givers and non-givers in America really are today, Brooks shows that giving is crucial to our economic prosperity, as well as to our happiness, health, and our ability to govern ourselves as a free people.</p><p>"There will of course be many readers (and many more nonreaders) of Mr. Brooks's book who will dismiss it on its face, and there will be fierce efforts mounted to discredit his analysis and data. Let them come. <i>Who Really Cares</i> should serve to change the public discussion dramatically. With any luck, it will be for our decade what Charles Murray's "Losing Ground" was for the 1980s (challenging the disincentive logic of welfare) or what Michael Harrington's "The Other America" was for the 1960s (highlighting the persistence of poverty amid affluence) &#x2500; the text at the center of a constructive national debate." &#x2500;<i>Wall Street Journal</i> <p> "The next time you find yourself in a conversation about how liberals are caring and compassionate while conservatives are selfish and hard-hearted, you might want to refer your interlocutors to <i>Who Really Cares</i>."--<i>First Things</i> (December 06) </p><p> "Provocative... It's not just that charity helps those on the receiving end, says Brooks, an economist at Syracuse University in New York. It also strengthens the cohesion of society at large. Moreover, it appears to make the givers themselves more successful, possibly because the activity transforms them somewhat into better or happier people. Whatever the reasons, he finds that higher income tends to push up charity - and that greater charity tends to push up income."--<i>Christian Science Monitor</i> (11/27/06) </p><p> "[B]reaks new ground... In WHO REALLY CARES, Arthur C. Brooks finds that religious conservatives are far more charitable than secular liberals, and that those who support the idea that government should redistribute income are among the least likely to dig into their own wallets to help others."--<i>Chronicle of Philanthropy</i> (11/23/06)</p><b>Arthur C. Brooks</b> is Louis A. Bantle Professor of Business and Government Policy at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The author of <i>Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism</i>, Brooks writes widely about the connections between culture, politics, and economic life in America, and his work appears frequently in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and other publications.

Cuba has fought three wars for independence and still is not free. People have been rounded up in reconcentration camps with too little food and too much illness. Rosa is a nurse, but she dares not go to the camps. So she turns hidden caves into hospitals for those who know how to find her. </p><p>Black, white, Cuban, Spanish&#x2015;Rosa does her best for everyone. Yet who can heal a country so torn apart by war? Acclaimed poet Margarita Engle has created another breathtaking portrait of Cuba.</p><p><i>The Surrender Tree</i> is a 2009 Newbery Honor Book, the winner of the 2009 Pura Belpre Medal for Narrative and the 2009 Bank Street - Claudia Lewis Award, and a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>Margarita Engle</b> is a Cuban American poet, novelist, and journalist whose work has been published in many countries. She is the author of young adult nonfiction books and novels in verse including <i>The Poet Slave of Cuba</i>, <i>Hurricane Dancers</i>, <i>The Firefly Letters</i>, and <i>Tropical Secrets</i>. <i>The Surrender Tree</i> was a Newbery Honor Book. She lives in northern California.</p>This fascinating, beautifully crafted history follows Cuba&#39;s nineteenth-century struggles for independence from Spain. In alternating viewpoints and voices, we hear from Rosa, a Cuban healer; Lieutenant Death, a slave hunter who chases her; and Weyler, a ruthless Spanish army officer. Written in free verse, the novel presents a challenge to the narrators, who have to respect both the form of the poetry and the flow of the story. Unfortunately, Yesenia Cabrero, who presents Rosa&#39;s parts (which make up the bulk of the audiobook), reads too slowly, often with the wrong emphasis, pausing because she comes to the end of a line, regardless of whether it&#39;s the end of a thought or a sentence. The four other narrators read more naturally, which makes Rosa&#39;s sections distract even more.

How can an ancient figure, enveloped in the fog of mystery and (in the opinion of today s cynical man) myth, fascinate the imagination and vision of modern scholars and preachers? They confront innumerable problems of enormous magnitude and force, and face situations which captivate their fantasy with both greatness and perplexing tragedy. Why should they investigate and probe a person who emerges from the unknown historic twilight, whose contours and features are blurred and almost imperceptible to the onlooker, while there is a world full of marvels, light, and charm that wink at and tantalize us? Why watch a bubble riding on the crest of a wave disappearing at the distant horizon, while a mighty tide rolls on toward us and breaks at our feet Excerpt from Abraham s Journey.<br><br>Abraham's Journey: Reflections on the Life of the Founding Patriarch focuses on the life of Avraham Avinu, founding patriarch of the Jewish People. Abraham was not only the first Jew, but also a historical prototype, his experiences and actions foreshadowing critical patterns in the history of his people. In addition, Abraham serves as a spiritual and ethical model to his descendants. He is a teacher, a paragon of kindness, a lonely iconoclast, a master of sacrifice, and a knight of faith. Through careful exegesis of verses, illuminating analyses of character, and insightful readings of classical commentators, the essays in this book seek both the eternal and the contemporary messages of the Abraham story. <br><br>Abraham s Journey is the ninth volume in MeOtzar HoRav: Selected Writings of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik.</p><p>Rabbi Soloveitchik, zt&#34;l, (1903-1993) was not only one of the outstanding talmudists of the twentieth century, but also one of its most creative and seminal Jewish thinkers. Drawing from a vast reservoir of Jewish and general knowledge, the Rav, as he is widely known, brought Jewish thought and law to bear on the interpretation and assessment of the modern experience. For over four decades, Rabbi Soloveitchik commuted weekly from his home in Brookline, Massachusetts to New York City, where he gave the senior sh iur (class in Talmud) at Yeshiva University s affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), where he taught and inspired generations of students, among them many of the future leaders of all areas of Jewish communal life. By his extensive personal teaching and influence, he contributed vitally to the dynamic resurgence of Orthodox Judaism in America.</p><h2>Pinky Pye</h2><p>An ALA Notable Book<br><br> &#x201c;A captivating story, told with loving tenderness, whimsical humor, suspense, it has all the special magic that is Eleanor Estes&#x2019; trademark. . . .

The paintings are as simple as the narrative; some show night and day with very large children on small planets (one is sleeping in darkness, the other is fishing in sunlight). Others show the passage of seasons as children go to school, celebrate birthdays, and stand by little trees in their various stages of growth. A few of the pictures go sideways in a manner that demonstrates some concepts very well; for example, gravity is concretely illustrated by figures standing on ground that runs perpendicular to the bottom of the page. Karas's distinctive cartoon figures will be familiar to anyone who knows his work, and his colors are gorgeous, even down to the endpapers (the front endpaper is sky blue and the back one is midnight blue).

With longer days and sunlight streaming down through bare branches of towering trees, life on the forest floor awakens from its winter sleep.

She is the author of <i>The River at Night </i>and <i>Into the Jungle</i>.The River at Night <br> <br>1<br> <br>Early one morning in late March, Pia forced my hand.<br> <br>A slapping spring wind ushered me through the heavy doors of the YMCA lobby as the minute hand of the yellowing 1950s-era clock over the check-in desk snapped to 7:09. Head down and on task to be in my preferred lane by precisely 7:15, I rushed along the glass corridor next to the pool. The chemical stink leaked from the ancient windows, as did the muffled shrieks of children and the lifeguard&#x2019;s whistle. I felt cosseted by the shabby walls, by my self-righteous routine, by the fact that I&#x2019;d ousted myself from my warm bed to face another tedious day head-on. Small victories.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d just squeezed myself into my old-lady swimsuit when the phone in my bag began to bleat. I dug it out. The screen pulsed with the image of Pia Zanderlee ski-racing down a double black diamond slope somewhere in Banff.<br> <br>My choices? Answer it now or play phone tag for another week. Pia was that friend you love with a twinge of resentment. The sparkly one who never has time for you unless it&#x2019;s on her schedule, but you like her too much to flush her down the friendship toilet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, a phone call&#x2014;from you!&#x201d; I said as I mercilessly assessed my middle-aged pudge in the greasy mirror. &#x201c;To what do I owe the honor?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course I knew the reason. Five unanswered texts.<br> <br>Pia laughed. &#x201c;Hey, Win, listen. We need to make our reservations. Like, by tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fished around in my swim bag for my goggles. &#x201c;Yeah, I �haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get it. Nature&#x2019;s not your thing, but you&#x2019;re going to love it once you&#x2019;re out there. Rachel and Sandra are chomping at the bit to go, but they have to make their travel plans. We all do.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a shudder, I recalled my frantic Google search the night before for Winnegosset River Rafting, Maine.<br> <br>No results.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just wondering why this place doesn&#x2019;t have some kind of website. I mean, is it legit?&#x201d; I asked, my voice coming out all high and tinny. Already I was ashamed of my wussiness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to get all the way up there and find out this is some sort of shady �operation&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>I could feel her roll her eyes. &#x201c;Wini, just because some place or something or someone doesn&#x2019;t have a website doesn&#x2019;t mean they don&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d; She sounded windblown, breathless. I pictured her power walking through her Cambridge neighborhood, wrist weights flashing neon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big old world out there. One of the reasons this place is so awesome is because no one knows about it yet, so it&#x2019;s not booked solid before the snow&#x2019;s even melted. That&#x2019;s why there&#x2019;s space for the weekend we all want, get it? This year, it&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s best-kept secret&#x2014;next year, forget it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Pia . . .&#x201d; I glanced at the time: 7:14.<br> <br>She laughed, softening to me now. &#x201c;Look, the guy who runs the white-water tours is a good friend of my dad&#x2014;he&#x2019;s my dad&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s son, I mean, so it&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t believe Rachel would want to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you crazy? She&#x2019;s dying to go. And Sandra? Please. She&#x2019;d get on a plane right now if she could.&#x201d;<br> <br>With a wave of affection I pictured my last Skype with Sandra: kids running around screaming in the background, papers to correct stacked next to her. When I brought up the trip, she&#x2019;d groaned, Hell, yes, I&#x2019;m game for anything&#x2014;just get me out of Dodge!<br> <br>&#x201c;Wini, listen up: Next year&#x2014;I promise, we&#x2019;ll go to a beach somewhere. Canc�n, Key West, you choose. Do nothing and just bake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, Pia, I&#x2019;m at the pool and I&#x2019;m going to lose my lane&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Swim. Then call me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tucked my flyaway dirty-blond bob&#x2014;the compromise cut for all hopelessly shitty hair&#x2014;under my bathing cap, then hustled my stuff into a locker and slammed it shut. Do nothing and just bake. Did she really think that was all I was interested in? Who was the one who rented the bike the last time we went to the Cape? Just me, as I recalled, while all of them sat around the rental pouring more and more tequila into the blender each day. And my God&#x2014;we were all pushing forty&#x2014;shouldn&#x2019;t awesome and cool be in the rearview mirror by now?<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I crossed the slimy tiles of the dressing room and pushed open the swinging doors to the pool. The air hit me, muggy and warm, dense with chlorine that barely masked an underwhiff of urine and sweat. Children laughed and punched at the blue water in the shallow end as I padded over to my favorite lane, which was . . . occupied.<br> <br>It was 7:16 and frog man had beat me to it. Fuck.<br> <br>For close to a year, this nonagenarian ear, nose, and throat doctor and I had been locked in a mostly silent daily battle over the best lane&#x2014;far left-hand side, under the skylights&#x2014;from 7:15 to 8:00 each weekday morning. Usually I was the victor, something about which I&#x2019;d felt ridiculous glee. We&#x2019;d only ever exchanged the briefest of greetings; both of us getting to the Y a notch earlier each day. I imagined we both craved this mindless exercise, thoughts freed by the calming boredom of swimming and near weightlessness.<br> <br>But today I&#x2019;d lost the battle. I plopped down on a hard plastic seat, pouting inside but feigning serenity as I watched him slap through his slow-motion crawl. He appeared to lose steam near the end of a lap, then climbed the ladder out of the pool as only a ninety-year-old can: with careful deliberation in every step. As I watched the water drip off his flat ass and down his pencil legs, I realized that he was making his way to me, or rather to a stack of towels next to me, and in a few seconds I&#x2019;d pretty much have to talk to him. He uncorked his goggles with a soft sucking sound. I noticed his eyes seemed a bit wearier than usual, even for a man his age who had just worked his daily laps.<br> <br>&#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; I shifted in my seat, conscious of my bathing cap squeezing my head and distorting my face as I stole the odd glance at the deliciously empty lane.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m well, thank you. Though very sad today.&#x201d;<br> <br>I studied him more closely now, caught off guard by his intimate tone. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Though his expression was grim, I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for what he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just lost my daughter to cancer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I choked out. I felt socked in the soft fleshy parts; smacked off the rails of my deeply grooved routine and whipped around to face something I didn&#x2019;t want to see.<br> <br>He took a towel and poked at his ears with it. A gold cross hung from a glimmering chain around his thin neck, the skin white and rubbery looking. &#x201c;It was a long struggle. Part of me is glad it&#x2019;s over.&#x201d; He squinted at me as if seeing me for the first time. &#x201c;She was about your age,&#x201d; he added, turning to walk away before I could utter a word of comfort. I watched him travel in his flap step the length of the pool to the men&#x2019;s lockers, his head held down so low I could barely see the top of it.<br> <br>My hands trembled as I gripped the steel ladder and made my way down into the antiseptic blue. I pushed off. Eyes shut tight and heart pumping, I watched the words She was about your age hover in my brain until the letters dissolved into nothingness. The horror of his offhand observation numbed me as I turned and floated on my back, breathing heavily in the oppressive air. As I slogged joylessly through my laps, I thought of my own father rolling his eyes when I said I was afraid of sleepaway camp, of third grade, of walking on grass barefoot &#x201c;because of worms.&#x201d; As cold as he could be to my brother and me, not a thing on earth seemed to frighten him.<br> <br>I had barely toweled myself off when my phone lit up with a text from Pia. A question mark, that was it. Followed by three more. Methodically I removed my work clothes from my locker, arranging them neatly on the bench behind me. I pulled off my bathing cap, sat down, and picked up the phone.<br> <br>My thumbs hovered over the keys as I shivered in the overheated locker room. I took a deep breath&#x2014;shampoo, rubber, mold, a sting of disinfectant&#x2014;and slowly let it out, a sharp pain lodging in my gut. I couldn&#x2019;t tell which was worse, the fear of being left behind by my friends as they dashed away on some �berbonding, unforgettable adventure, or the inevitable self-loathing if I stayed behind like some gutless wimp&#x2014;safe, always safe&#x2014;half-fucking-dead with safety. Why couldn&#x2019;t I just say yes to a camping trip with three of my best friends? What was I so afraid of?<br> <br>Pool water dripped from my hair, beading on the phone as I commanded myself to text something.<br> <br>Anything.<br> <br>I watched my fingers as they typed, Okay, I&#x2019;m in, and pressed send.</p><h2>Skip Beat!

The milkman's horse neighed softly in the alley beneath the window.<br><br>Joshua yawned and stretched in the small brass bed. His room wasn't heated, and the January morning was cold. His mother was already clattering pans in the kitchen. Before the Spanish Influenza struck the family several months ago, things had been different. Every morning his mother used to sleep late while Annie, the housekeeper, brought coffee and toast up to the big bedroom. Dad would be shaving and humming in the bathroom. Joshua's morning had been full of his father's singing, his mother's soft laughter when Dad teased her from her sleep, and the smell of coffee.<br><br>That was before that awful day -- the day Joshua's father died from the virulent pneumonia that was part of the influenza. Just when it seemed that the whole family would recover, Joshua's dad lost his fight. The flu epidemic had taken another victim.<br><br>Mom didn't laugh anymore. Instead, she cried late at night and banged the pots and pans early in the morning. <br><br>Two weeks ago, Christmas had been a disaster. Just one long, dreary time of sadness and memories. <br><br>Things were even worse now. Instead of heading back to school after the Christmas and New Year holidays, Joshua had to look for a job. "We don't have much money, Josh," Mom had said. "We have to tighten our belts and find ways to get along. I've had to let poor Annie go, and now you'll need to pitch in and find work." <br><br>Joshua punched his pillow. Surely he would wake up from this nightmare and everything would be the way it used to be. But it was no dream.<br><br>"What about me?" Joshua said out loud, hating the guttural sound of his voice. His dad was gone. He'd been dismissed from the boys' choir because his voice changed. Now he couldn't go to school. The rugby team had a good chance of winning the pennant, too! What else could go wrong?<br><br>Joshua pushed his comforter away and sat up. He'd put off looking for a job all week. It was Friday. He'd have to go job hunting today. <br><br>The old gas lights had been sealed when the house was electrified ten years ago. Joshua tugged the long string attached to a bulb. The light glared in his eyes.<br><br>He looked out the window at the dismal day. The milkman had deposited bottles of milk and cream on their back stoop, and the horse pulling the carriage was clomping down the cobblestone alley. Next door, the neighbor had opened his carriage house and was cranking up his brand-new Model T Ford.<br><br>Joshua washed quietly in the bathroom. Then he tiptoed back to his room to dress -- careful not to wake Mrs. Fryor, who snored loudly down the hall in the room that used to be his. <br><br>Pushing aside the knickers that hung neatly in the closet, Joshua grabbed his blue suit and tossed it on the bed. He didn't want to go to work. He didn't know the first thing about job hunting. <br><br>But he had to go.<br><br>After dressing he brushed his blond hair with some pomade, then headed to the kitchen.<br><br>"Good morning, Josh," his mother greeted him. She put a pot of coffee on the gas stove, then looked her son up and down. "Good! You're wearing your best suit. It makes you look older." <br><br>"Do you think I can go back to school someday?" Joshua asked. <br><br>Mom turned her attention to a pot of bubbling oatmeal. "I'm sorry. I can't afford to send you back to the academy this year. Even public school is out of the question. We really need money, Josh. Your father made some poor investments, and...well, you don't need to worry about all the details. Once things settle down and we get all the rooms rented, maybe..." She turned a switch on the stove, and the burner flame went out with a loud <i>POP!</i> "Maybe I'll even get the electric stove I've always wanted."<br><br>Joshua recalled what Mr. Williams, the family lawyer, had told them right after Dad's death. His father had left only a small insurance policy and an even smaller bank account, along with large, outstanding debts.<br><br>"You finished eighth grade early, and with high marks, too," Mom continued. "Your father had great hopes for you, Joshua." She looked sad as she spooned oatmeal into a bowl and sprinkled brown sugar over it. "It will be hard to find decent work now that the war is over. You're only thirteen, and I don't want you working in a sweat shop."<br><br>"I'm going to Dad's bank to see if they need a messenger." <br><br>"No!" Mom said quickly. "Not there! Can't you try another bank? Or perhaps a department store? C. Crawford Hollidge is a nice store. Of course I wouldn't want anyone to see you there, but if you could work in the office..."<br><br>"You don't want anyone to know I'm working, do you." It wasn't a question.<br><br>"It will be better that way. After all, we have our pride. Perhaps you could find work with one of the music publishers. They would probably remember you from the Boston Boys' Choir."<br><br>"No!" Joshua snapped. "I told you I'm finished with music."<br><br>Mom shook her head and pulled the pot onto the side of the stove. "Don't eat any more of this oatmeal, Joshua. Aunt Caroline always has a big breakfast." <br><br>"Mrs. Fryor is not <i>my</i> aunt," Joshua grumbled. <br><br>Mom sat at the table. "I told you, our neighbors would never tolerate a rooming house on their street. I don't want them to know we have a paying boarder. So, she is now your Aunt Caroline."<br><br>"She's so cranky and mean. It's no wonder her family put her out." <br><br>"Hush! It's a shame when someone gets old, to think their family doesn't want them," Mom whispered. "Besides, they didn't put her out. They're paying a nice monthly fee for us to keep her here." <br><br>"She's got <i>my</i> bedroom," Joshua reminded her. He opened a bottle of cream and drizzled it on his oatmeal.<br><br>"Things have to be different now." Mom touched his shoulder. "Be careful where you go today. Stay away from the tenements. And please don't go to your father's bank."<br><br>When Joshua finished his oatmeal, he pulled on his bulky overcoat. Mom handed him some coins. "Take the El, Josh. Remember, you don't want just <i>any</i> job." She kissed him on the forehead. "I'll worry if you're not back before dark."<br><br>Joshua had only taken the elevated train twice by himself and then he had gone directly to State Street to Dad's bank. He felt queasy. Mom was treating him as if he were suddenly all grown up -- like she was expecting him to find work and take Dad's place or something. It wasn't fair!<br><br>Joshua headed out the front door. Nightshade Lane was awake now. A couple of automobiles rattled down the street, steering around a horse and carriage. Joshua remembered how excited and proud they were when Dad bought their new Peerless automobile. But the first thing Mom did after Dad died, was to sell it to Mr. Williams. Since then, when it was too far to walk, they had to take a cab or the El.<br><br>They lived in a nice neighborhood not far from downtown Boston, on a street of brick-front houses with bay windows and wrought-iron gates. How long would they be able to live here? Joshua wondered as he headed toward the elevated station on the next block. And where on earth would he ever find work? <br><br>Joshua paid his fare and found a seat next to the window. Well-dressed patrons got on at his stop, but he noticed poorer people coming aboard as the train continued into town. There were men in overalls and women in faded coats. Even children, carrying lunch pails, were on their way to work. Joshua almost asked one boy where he was employed, thinking there might be a job for him in the same place. The boy's eyes seemed far away, though, and Joshua changed his mind remembering what his father had told him: "Don't talk to strangers in town. Some of them are from different worlds, Josh."<br><br>Several passengers wore gauze masks. The influenza epidemic had everyone afraid. Joshua turned his face to the window -- away from the man who was coughing next to him. Even though Joshua had already had the flu, he wasn't taking any chances. <br><br>The sun was shining brightly and streaming through the grimy windows. The train stopped again, and the sweet aroma of chocolate from the nearby candy factory drifted into the car. The slender, gray Custom House Tower piercing the skyline caught Joshua's attention.<br><br>Dad never did get to take him to the top of the tower like they had planned. Dad said the city was beautiful from up there, but Josh would never see it now. <br><br>The warmth and the constant rattle of the train made Joshua sleepy. He closed his eyes.<br><br>His thoughts drifted back to Dad's funeral. <br><br><i>The sweet smell of flowers and fresh earth of the new graves permeated the cemetery. There were many other families weeping over new graves, too. Thousands had perished in the influenza outbreak.<br><br>Mom asked, "Josh, won't you sing one hymn for us? 'A Prayer to the Good Shepherd' was your father's favorite."<br><br>"No!" Joshua's voice rang out over the soft murmurs of relatives and friends. "Don't ask me to sing. I can't. Not at Dad's funeral!"</i><br><br>"Hey, boy!" Someone shook Joshua's arm. The man in the next seat. "Wake up."<br><br>Joshua awoke with a start. "Where are we?" he asked.<br><br>"This is Atlantic Avenue." <br><br>Joshua had missed his stop. He got off the El and looked around, bewildered. The icy air smelled of sea and fish. Where was he? He blocked his eyes from the sun and saw the Custom House Tower. State Street must be nearby. <br><br>Horses and carriages crowded the streets. The blaring honks of automobile horns added to the commotion. On the opposite sidewalk a man with a brightly colored wheelbarrow called out, "Fresh haddock and halibut!" <br><br>A newsboy, who looked to be about sixteen, darted around the traffic, hollering out the headlines. His brown woolen knickers were held up by bright red suspenders. Plaid shirttails hung below his open jacket. Strands of unruly carrot-colored hair had slipped out from under his soft gray cap. Joshua watched the boy in awe as he wove in and out between the cars and the carriages, yelling in a high-pitched voice, "Extra! Robbery in Revere." He'd stop at each vehicle, slide the latest copy of the newspaper into the driver's window, and grab the coins with the same hand.<br><br>Suddenly the traffic unsnarled and started moving again. The newsboy hopped onto the sidewalk, bumping into Joshua. <br><br>"Hey, you! Watch where you're going!" the boy exclaimed, scowling at Joshua. "Get outta my way."<br><br>Joshua struggled to retain his balance. "You bumped into <i>me!"</i><br><br>The newsboy stepped closer. "Don't argue with me, pip-squeak." <br><br>"I wasn't arguing," Joshua snapped. "Get away from me."<br><br>At this moment two more boys, who also carried newspaper bags over their shoulders, appeared. One -- a tall, skinny fellow -- shook his finger at Joshua. "Don't you know you're askin' for trouble?" he warned. "This is Charlestown Charlie himself!"<br><br>"Did you hear what Shawn said?" The redheaded newsboy put his face close to Joshua's -- so close, Joshua could almost count the freckles that dotted his nose. "Everyone in Boston -- except you -- knows it don't pay to argue with <i>me."</i> And Charlestown Charlie gave Joshua a shove that knocked him to the ground.<br><br>Text copyright � 2001 by Joan Hiatt Harlow<br><br>Illustrations copyright � 2001 by Larry Day</p><h2>Happier at Home: Kiss More, Jump More, Abandon Self-Control, and My Other Experiments in Everyday Life</h2><p><b>In the spirit of her blockbuster #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Happiness Project,</i> Gretchen Rubin embarks on a new project to make home a happier place.<br></b>&nbsp;<br>One Sunday afternoon, as she unloaded the dishwasher, Gretchen Rubin felt hit by a wave of homesickness. Homesick&#x2014;why? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. &#x201c;Of all the elements of a happy life,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;my home is the most important.&#x201d; In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home.<br><br>And what did she want from her home? A place that calmed her, and energized her. A place that, by making her feel safe, would free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wanted to be happier at home, she wanted to appreciate how much happiness was there already.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicated a school year&#x2014;September through May&#x2014;to making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort, and love.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Happiness Project,</i> she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her family&#x2019;s treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster.<br>&nbsp;<br>Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutions&#x2014;and this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With her signature blend of memoir, science, philosophy, and experimentation, Rubin&#x2019;s passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire readers to find more happiness in their own lives.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Gretchen Rubin</b> is one of the most thought-provoking and influential writers on the linked subjects of habits, happiness, and human nature. She's the author of many books, including the blockbuster <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, <i>Better Than Before</i> and <i>The Happiness Project</i>. A member of Oprah's SuperSoul 100, Rubin has an enormous following, in print and online; her books have sold more than two million copies worldwide, in more than thirty-five languages, and on her popular daily blog, gretchenrubin.com, she reports on her adventures in pursuit of habits and happiness. She also has a highly ranked, award-winning podcast, <i>Happier with Gretchen Rubin</i>. Rubin started her career in law, and was clerking for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor when she realized she wanted to be a writer. She lives in New York City with her husband and two daughters.September<br><br>Possessions<br><br>Find a True Simplicity<br><br>We need to project ourselves into the things around us. My self is not confined to my body. It extends into all the things I have made and all the things around me. Without these things, I would not be myself.<br><br>&#x2014;Carl Jung, C. G. Jung Speaking<br><br>Once the season of the harvest, now the season of la rentr�e, September has always been a milestone month for me, and this September had particular significance: After the first week of school, Eliza walked to school alone. Although she has a safe walk of just nine blocks, we both were nervous the first time she left by herself, but after that morning, she was thrilled with her new independence. The change was bittersweet for me, because I would miss our time together.<br><br>Oh well, I comforted myself, Eleanor was just starting kindergarten; I still had many years of morning walks ahead of me. Last May, at the end of nursery school, Eleanor had seemed so big, but in her new school, she was little all over again. As I led her into her classroom on that first morning, I loved seeing the construction-paper decorations, the block area and the dress-up clothes, the rows of carefully labeled cubbies. Already, I felt deeply sentimental.<br><br>When I considered how to be happier at home, I thought first of Eliza, Eleanor, and Jamie. The contents of my home and its architecture mattered much less than its occupants. But while home was the people in it, it was also the physical space and the objects that surrounded me there. I decided to start my happiness project with the theme of &#x201c;Possessions,&#x201d; not because I thought possessions were the most important aspect of my home&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;but because I knew that in many cases, my possessions blocked my view and weighed me down. Before I wrestled with deeper challenges that struck closer to my heart&#x2014;in the months devoted to &#x201c;Marriage,&#x201d; &#x201c;Parenthood,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Family&#x201d;&#x2014;I wanted to feel more in control of stuff.<br><br>My theme of &#x201c;Possessions,&#x201d; however, wouldn&#x2019;t extend to furniture, wallpaper, bathroom tile, or any permanent aspect of the apartment. Although I knew that many people might be eager to address the home-decor aspect of home, I&#x2019;d never been interested in interior design&#x2014;window treatments, kitchen countertops, or anything else&#x2014;that is, until I read the haunting, evocative book A Pattern Language. In it, visionary architect Christopher Alexander and his team identify 253 &#x201c;patterns&#x201d; that repeat through the architecture that people find most pleasing. As I read about these patterns, I began to fantasize for the first time about living in a dream house, one that incorporated patterns such as &#x201c;Sleeping to the East,&#x201d; &#x201c;Staircase as a Stage,&#x201d; &#x201c;Garden Growing Wild,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Fire,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Private Terrace on the Street.&#x201d; I wanted them all. But although Alexander&#x2019;s grand system of archetypes enthralled me, our current apartment either had elements such as &#x201c;Window Place&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sunny Counter,&#x201d; or, in most cases, it didn&#x2019;t. For this month of Possessions, I would limit myself to the movable objects inside our apartment.<br><br>Within the larger subject of happiness, the proper relationship of possessions to happiness is hotly debated. People often argue that possessions don&#x2019;t&#x2014;or shouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;matter much to happiness, but I think they do.<br><br>Some research suggests that spending money on an experience brings more happiness than buying a possession, but the line between possessions and experiences isn&#x2019;t always simple to draw. The latest pair of skis is tied to the fun of skiing, and a fashionable dress adds to the fun of meeting friends. A camera is a possession that helps keep happy memories vivid&#x2014;a big happiness booster. A dog is a possession, an experience, a relationship. Also, many wonderful experiences require, or are enhanced by, possessions. Camping is easier with a great tent. Throwing a Halloween party is more fun with wonderful decorations. Choosing postcards enhances the pleasures of traveling. Part of the fun of fly-fishing is picking out the equipment. Also, for many people, shopping itself is an enjoyable experience; acquisition of possessions is part of the fun, but not all of the fun.<br><br>People&#x2019;s desire for possessions can change over time. A friend told me, &#x201c;For years, I loved the feeling that I could pack up my apartment in an afternoon, load it into my car, and drive away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like that character in the movie Sex, Lies, and Videotape, who said, &#x2018;I just like having the one key,&#x2019; &#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly! I felt so free. I could do anything, go anywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you still feel that way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Over time, I&#x2019;ve started to want to have more things. I&#x2019;m still single, so I can live any way I want, but now I want to be settled someplace, with my things around me.&#x201d;<br><br>We often deny the importance of possessions, or feel embarrassed by our enthusiasm for them, but the desire to possess has roots very deep in human nature. &#x201c;Although there are a few societies in which notions of ownership are absent or downplayed,&#x201d; observe researchers Gail Steketee and Randy Frost in Stuff, &#x201c;in most cultures the interaction between people and their things is a central aspect of life.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, the practice of denying the importance of possessions is also ancient, and many cultures extol the principle of nonattachment and the relinquishment of worldly goods. It&#x2019;s certainly true that possessions, or the desire for possessions, can undermine happiness, and that some people are happier when they own very little. I once had a long conversation with a twenty-three-year-old guy who tried to convince me how happy I&#x2019;d be if only I would downsize to one backpack of stuff. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much more serene I feel, now that I&#x2019;ve gotten rid of practically everything,&#x201d; he said earnestly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For you,&#x201d; I said, with a laugh. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not the answer for everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>For me, I knew, possessions had a role to play. In fact, one of my goals for the month was to glean more happiness from my possessions.<br><br>The fact is, attachment brings happiness, and attachment brings unhappiness. Love&#x2014;for people, for possessions, for a place, for an animal, for a house, for anything&#x2014;exposes us to the pain of loss. It&#x2019;s inescapable. We can mitigate that pain by moderating or even eliminating attachment, but while something is gained, something is also relinquished. I wanted to love my possessions, and yet not be mastered by them.<br><br>In the persistent debate over the proper role of possessions and spending, I often heard the argument &#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful; people are so materialistic. They think that money and buying things can make them happy, but they can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>This statement contains more than one idea. The first idea is that &#x201c;Money can&#x2019;t buy happiness.&#x201d; True, money can&#x2019;t buy happiness, but spent wisely, it can buy things that contribute mightily to a happy life. People&#x2019;s most pressing worries include financial anxiety, health concerns, job insecurity, and having to do tiring and boring chores, and money can help to relieve these problems. Money can help us stay close to other people, which is perhaps the key to happiness. It can help us support causes we believe in. It can help us pursue activities that bring us happiness, whether raising children, planting a flower garden, or planning a vacation.<br><br>The second idea is that people (not us or our friends, of course, but other people) are too &#x201c;materialistic,&#x201d; that is, they place too much importance on owning things and showing them off. True, people who are materialistic tend to have unrealistically high expectations of the power of material things, and they seek to define themselves, or raise their status, or make themselves happier through possessions. Studies show that highly materialistic people are less happy, though which is the cause and which is the consequence isn&#x2019;t clear.<br><br>However, in some situations, behavior that might outwardly seem &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d; has a nonmaterialistic cause. Conspicuous consumption doesn&#x2019;t explain every flashy purchase. For instance, I have a friend who&#x2019;s always the first to buy the latest gizmo&#x2014;not to show that he can afford it, but to feed his fascination with technology. Clothes are a puzzle. Some people appreciate beautiful clothes for their own sake; it&#x2019;s not all about making a display for other people, though that&#x2019;s part of it, too. Virginia Woolf noted in her diary: &#x201c;But I must remember to write about my clothes next time I have an impulse to write. My love of clothes interests me profoundly; only it is not love; and what it is I must discover.&#x201d; Is this love purely &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d;?<br><br>For better or worse, buying things (or photographing them, cataloging them, or writing reviews about them) is a way to engage with the world. When we&#x2019;re interested in something, we often express that interest by researching, shopping, buying, and collecting. People who love art go to museums, but when they can afford it, they usually want to buy art, too. People who love to cook enjoy buying kitchen tools and exotic ingredients. The latest sports equipment probably isn&#x2019;t much different from what&#x2019;s already in the closet. We crave to buy and possess the things we love, even when it&#x2019;s not necessary. I&#x2019;m interested in reading The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin only every so often, and my neighborhood library has two copies, yet I want my own copy. When we possess things, we often want to show and share them with other people. Is that necessarily &#x201c;materialistic&#x201d; behavior?<br><br>Many of the most precious possessions are valuable not because of their cost or prestige, but because of the meanings they contain; modest trinkets, homemade objects, worn books, old photographs, whimsical collections. (After someone&#x2019;s death, how strange to see the value drain away from his or her possessions; useful household objects such as clothes, or dish towels, or personal papers become little more than trash.)<br><br>Because we often want to deny the importance of possessions, and because we don&#x2019;t want to seem materialistic, we often don&#x2019;t spend enough time and attention thinking about how possessions could boost happiness&#x2014;or at least I didn&#x2019;t. My possessions had a powerful influence over the atmosphere of my home, and they contributed to, and reflected, my sense of identity.<br><br>Was it possible to be happy with very few possessions? Yes. Were some people happier when they owned almost nothing? Yes. But for most people, including me, possessions, wisely chosen, could be a boon to happiness.<br><br>Possessions have a role to play in happiness, yet it seemed as though every time I visited a bookstore, turned on the TV, or picked up a newspaper or magazine, I heard the message &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be happier with less!&#x201d; Whenever I fell into conversation with people about the subject of happiness at home, I often heard the response, &#x201c;Oh, I need to simplify.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of the great minds in history urge us toward simplicity. Thoreau admonished, &#x201c;Our life is frittered away by detail. . . . Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!&#x201d; This longing for simplicity is so powerful and complex that it needs its own term, much like nostalgie de la boue (yearning for the mud) or wabi sabi (the beauty of the imperfect and impermanent). When I asked on my blog if anyone knew a term to capture this idea, one reader coined the wonderful word &#x201c;Waldenlust.&#x201d; This longing takes several forms: fantasies of the freedom that dispossession would bring; nostalgia for earlier, supposedly simpler times; and reverence for the primitive, which is assumed to be more authentic and closer to nature.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve often felt a yearning to escape from the ties of ownership. I&#x2019;ve wanted to dump the entire contents of a chest of drawers into the trash rather than endure the headache of sorting the good from the bad. I often choose not to buy something useful or beautiful, because I don&#x2019;t want the responsibility of another possession. Years ago, walking through a convenience store parking lot in some small, nameless California town, I had a sudden vision of abandoning everything, my possessions, relationships, ambition, to disappear, unencumbered. What care I for my goose-feather bed?&#x2014;I&#x2019;m away with the raggle-taggle gypsies-o. Sometimes, too, in an eerie, dark reversal, I love something so much that I feel the urge to destroy it, to be free from that attachment and the fear of loss. (I was so puzzled by this impulse that I wrote a book about it, Profane Waste.)<br><br>One friend had a particularly acute case of Waldenlust. He was headed to his parents&#x2019; house to go through the twenty boxes he&#x2019;d stored there. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s terrible to say, but I really wish there&#x2019;d be a fire or a flood,&#x201d; he said ruefully. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d be done. I hate the thought of dealing with all that stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you doing it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My parents are really annoyed. I promised I&#x2019;d leave the boxes there just temporarily, but they&#x2019;ve been there a year now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you haven&#x2019;t needed anything for a year, maybe nothing&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you wish everything would get destroyed in a fire, maybe you could throw the boxes away, without going through them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I couldn&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; he shook his head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t just throw it all away, even if I don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. I understood the demands of those dusty cardboard boxes. Even though they sat neglected and unwanted, somehow they held pieces of&#x2014;himself? the past?&#x2014;that couldn&#x2019;t be discarded recklessly.<br><br>In the past few years, I&#x2019;d made great headway in conquering my own clutter, but I still wasn&#x2019;t free from it. The press of superfluous possessions made me feel unsettled and harried, and the demands required by acquisition, use, maintenance, storage, and even relinquishment ate up my energy and time.<br><br>However, although I wanted to simplify, I also feared that I was too inclined to simplify. Of course, the virtues of simplicity lay far deeper than mere elimination, yet I saw a danger in my craving; I didn&#x2019;t want to be tempted to cut away too much.<br><br>The first principle of my happiness project was to &#x201c;Be Gretchen.&#x201d; One important way to &#x201c;Be Gretchen&#x201d; was not to assume that virtues that others strive to cultivate are the ones that I should strive for. Others strive to save; I push myself to spend out. Others try to work more; I try to play more. Others strive for simplicity; I fight the simplifying impulse, because if anything, I cultivate too much simplicity&#x2014;not a disciplined, thoughtful simplicity, but one created by indifference and neglect.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a lassitude deep in my soul; I always have to fight my urge to do nothing. If I didn&#x2019;t have to consider Jamie and my daughters, if I didn&#x2019;t have my mother to coach me along, I&#x2019;d be living in a studio with bare walls, crooked blinds, and a futon on the floor, forever. For some, that simplicity would seem attractive and perhaps even admirable, but not to me. In my case, it would be the simplicity of evasion and apathy, not the simplicity of beautiful emptiness or voluntary poverty.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always been this way. After I graduated from college, I lived in a house in Washington, D.C., with three friends. After the first year, one of my housemates said kindly, &#x201c;The thing about living with you, Gretchen, is that you don&#x2019;t subtract, and you don&#x2019;t add. You never leave a mess, and you never bring home a dessert or call the cable guy.&#x201d; Which was so obviously true that it didn&#x2019;t even hurt my feelings.</p><h2>Letters to Penthouse Vol. 52: Dirty Girls and Sexy Toys (Penthouse Adventures, 52)</h2><p>Touch me, toy with me...<br><br>Toys aren't just for the playroom anymore.

Yes, it still pops up every now and then in some country songs or your latest folk hit, but overall, songwriters are moving away from telling fully fleshed-out stories through their songs. <br><br>This in turn means one very important aspect of songwriting just falls by the wayside: dramaturgy. What storytelling did for centuries (going all the way back to bards) is provide a reason for listening to the whole song: If you wanna know what happens to Georgie, you have to keep listening. Every songwriter knows: Give the audience a good story and they'll stick around. <br><br>Now look at the following songs:<br><ul><li>Sam Smith - <i>Stay With Me, </i></li><li>Katy Perry - <i>I Kissed A Girl, </i></li><li>Rihanna - <i>Umbrella, </i></li><li>Jennifer Lopez - <i>Booty, </i></li><li>Beyonc� Knowles - <i>Drunk In Love (feat. Jay-Z)</i></li></ul>Are these songs big storytellers? Do you stick around because you wanna know more about J-Lo's butt (ok, bad example)? Does your life depend on finding out what Katy Perry has to say in verse 2? No. These songs - as 95% of all the songs on the radio today - describe moments, emotions, things. Story is dead. Or is it? <br><br>With this book I present to you an approach to songwriting that is all about telling a captivating story - without actually telling a story. In fact, each song named above does tell a story the addictive way and could have been written using the approach. <br><br>I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel here. Our goal is to write compelling, commercial tracks that fit into the radio format. But as you'll see, the Addiction Formula can help you get there much, much faster and with laser precision - over and over again. And best of all: It's so deviously simple you can learn it in 4 hours.</p><h2>32 Ways To OutSmart Cancer: Create A Body In Which Cancer Cannot Thrive</h2><p>32 Ways To OutSmart Cancer, Create A Body In Which Cancer Cannot Thrive, is the definitive step-by-step roadmap to a cancer-free life.

Financial guru Jim Cramer shows how ordinary investors can prosper, no matter the climate on Wall Street.<br><br>How do we find hot stocks without getting burned? How do we fatten our portfolios and stay financially healthy? Former hedge-fund manager and longtime Wall Street commentator Jim Cramer explains how to invest wisely in chaotic times, and he does so in plain English in a style that is as much fun as investing is&#x2014;or should be, when it&#x2019;s done right.<br> <br> For starters, Cramer recommends devoting a portion of your assets to speculation. Everyone wants to find the big winners that can bring outsized gains, and Cramer explains how to allocate your portfolio so that you can afford to take this kind of risk wisely. He explains why &#x201c;buy and hold&#x201d; is a losing philosophy: For Cramer, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;buy and homework.&#x201d; If you can&#x2019;t spend an hour a week researching each of your stocks, then you should hand off your portfolio to a mutual fund&#x2014;and Cramer identifies the very few mutual funds that he&#x2019;d recommend.<br> <br> Cramer reveals his Ten Commandments of Trading (Commandment #5: Tips are for waiters). He explains why he&#x2019;s not afraid to compare investing to gambling (and tells you which book on gambling you should read to become a better investor). He discloses his Twenty-Five Rules of Investing (Rule #4: Look for broken stocks, not broken companies).<br> <br> Cramer shows how to compare stock prices in a way that you can understand, how to spot market tops and bottoms, how to know when to sell, how to rotate among cyclical stocks to catch the big moves, and much more. <i>Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Real Money</i> is filled with insider advice that really works, information that Cramer himself used to make millions during his fourteen-year career on Wall Street.<br> <br> Written in Cramer&#x2019;s distinctive turbocharged style, this is every investor&#x2019;s guide to what you really must know to make big money in the stock market.</p><p>James J. Cramer<b> </b>is host of CNBC&#x2019;s <i>Mad Money </i>and cofounder of TheStreet.com. His many books include <i>Confessions of a Street Addict, Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Getting Back to Even, Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Mad Money, Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Real Money, Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Stay Mad for Life.</i>Jim Cramer&#x2019;s Real Money 1<p></p> <br> STAYING in the GAME<p></p> <br> <br>If you look through my wallet, you will find all the things that everyone carries: license, credit cards, pictures of my wife and kids, and some cash. But if you look deeper, in some of the crannies, you&#x2019;ll find two things no one else has: my first pay stub, a tattered, faded beauty from the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper from September 1977, and a snippet of a portfolio run from the lowest day of my life, October 8, 1998.<br> <br>I keep these talismans with me wherever I go, because they remind me why I got into stocks and why I had to stay in stocks no matter what, because the opportunities are too great not to be in them. The $178.82 I made that first week as a general assignment reporter in Tallahassee serves as a reminder to me that a paycheck is almost never enough to make a decent living on and to save up for the necessities of later life. That torn and bedraggled stub, with its $30 in overtime and oversized take by the federal government, keeps me honest and reminds me where I am from, how I never want to go back there, and how hard work at your job isn&#x2019;t enough to make you rich. You have to invest to make that happen. If you invest well you should almost always be beating the return you get on your day job.<br> <br>The other smudged rectangle of paper in my wallet, the one that obscures the right-hand corner of my wife&#x2019;s picture, bears a series of cryptic numbers: 190,259,865; 281,175,544; and 90,915,674. The last number has a big black minus sign right after it. That&#x2019;s a cutout from my daily portfolio run on the most disastrous day my hedge fund ever had, October 8, 1998, a day when I was down $90,915,674&#x2014;that&#x2019;s right, more than $90 million on the $281 million that I was supposed to be managing. I had &#x201c;lost&#x201d; almost half the money under my management in a series of bets in the stock market that hadn&#x2019;t yet paid off, to put a positive spin on an unmitigated decline. At that moment, everyone&#x2014;my investors, my employees, the press, the public&#x2014;everyone had written me off, except for my wife, whom I had worked with for so many years and who knew never to count me out. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve had it, Cramer, you are gone,&#x201d; the collective brokerage chorus told me.<br> <br>Not two months before I had been on the cover of Money magazine as the greatest trader of the era. Now I was wondering whether I could survive the year. With just two months left, I had to find a way at least to make back that $90 million if I wanted to stay in a business that I had thought I was born for. Most hedge funds don&#x2019;t come back from those kinds of titanic losses.<br> <br>Using the very same techniques and tactics I will describe here, I methodically made back all of the money I had lost to date that year, and by December I had returned to a slim profit for the year. I finished up 2 percent, a $110 million comeback in less than three months. I averaged $1.4 million in profits every single day. Yet I still waived my management fee of $2 million because I didn&#x2019;t think I deserved a penny given how I had almost broken the bank. I still don&#x2019;t think I deserve to get paid for a comeback, because I dug my own hole by not following my disciplines and my rules, by succumbing to a lack of diversification and to inflexibility, those two assassins of capital.<br> <br>That snapshot of how close I came to failure reminds me how important it is to stay investing and trading stocks no matter what because they are just too lucrative to stay away from for any long period of time. It also serves to remind me of how humbling this business is and how important it is to adjust course, for I had been sloppy and blind to a changing market during that catastrophic year. Had I not been flexible and willing to change strategies, I would never have come back.<br> <br>In the very next year after my near-cataclysmic debacle, I made more than $100 million. The following year I made $150 million, again using the same rules and techniques I will describe here. I had plenty of help in the $100 million year: the market was terrific, easy, almost straight up. But in 2000, the biggest year, the $150 million year, the market peaked and crashed, yet I still profited supremely because you don&#x2019;t need the market to go up to make money. The fact that almost every mutual fund lost money in my biggest year is not a statement about my stock-picking prowess but evidence that if you are disciplined, use common sense, and take advantage of all the devices and tools out there, you can profit no matter what. Or, as I say at the end of my radio show every day, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a bull market somewhere&#x201d; that you can make profits from.<br> <br>But you have to stay in that game to find that bull market. In the end, when all else fails, &#x201c;Stay in the game&#x201d; is the only mantra that&#x2019;s worth repeating. It keeps you from picking stocks that can wipe you out. It keeps you from speculating on situations that are worthless. It keeps you from borrowing a lot of money, known as margining, and hoping that stocks will make a magical move upward. It keeps you from wallowing in worthless penny stocks. It keeps you from trying to make a killing in tech. And it stops you from averaging down on bad stocks, because stocks aren&#x2019;t like parents when you get lost at the mall; they don&#x2019;t always come back. Staying in the game is the ultimate lesson. How do I know this? Because it is what I have done. I have been able to make big money when big money could be made because I didn&#x2019;t get discouraged or fed up or desperate when times got tough. I didn&#x2019;t do anything illegal or silly or unethical to stay in the game because I knew that when the game eventually turned, I would be there to pounce on what was to be gained. Staying in the game makes sense rationally and empirically because, over the long term, we know stocks outperform all asset classes. The reason more people don&#x2019;t get rich with stocks, though, is that people can&#x2019;t seem to stay in long enough to win. They get bored, tired, frustrated, defeated, or reckless. They get discouraged. They get beaten by the unnerving and jarring and humbling process not of investing but investing successfully.<br> <br>My methods are designed to keep you from getting discouraged and quitting. Staying in the game is key, it is everything, and if you can&#x2019;t stay in the game then you have failed. And I have failed. I can&#x2019;t let that happen.<br> <br>But before I take too much credit for the system and methodology I used to keep me making money, I have to give credit where it is due, to my wife, Karen, the woman the Street called the Trading Goddess for her manner and her proficiency in managing money and barking orders to dozens of brokers and traders. Karen was a professional institutional trader before I met her. She was responsible for taking me to the next level. She took a kid who had an eye for spotting undervalued and overvalued stocks, then she grafted on a set of rules, all of which are included in this book, that have seen me through the darkest hours and allowed me to outperform even when I don&#x2019;t have a great set of stocks on hand. She is like a master card player who can turn a good hand into a great one with a couple of tosses and a keen sense of what&#x2019;s in the deck. In fact, on the day that my portfolio &#x201c;run&#x201d; dripped with $90 million in red ink, she had to return to the office to reinstill the rules and disciplines that I had forgotten in the three years since she had retired. She again drilled them into my head, so they now tumble out here almost by rote.<br> <br>Mrs. Cramer&#x2019;s Rules, the Rules of the Trading Goddess, make up a large portion of this book. Like me, Karen had no formal business school or accounting training. Like me, she lived from paycheck to paycheck until she found her true calling, making money in the stock market from scratch. Unlike me, she had no fundamental knowledge of how business worked or how to read a balance sheet or how interest rates control what you will ultimately pay for a stock. She always regarded those skills as overrated. What she understood was discipline and skepticism: the discipline to cut losses and run winners, and the skepticism to see through the hype that surrounds us on Wall Street. She understood better than anyone I have ever met that stocks are just pieces of paper representing shares of companies and no more than that. She knew that you could have conviction about where stocks could go and how high they could go, but it was only discipline that saved you when things didn&#x2019;t work out the way you thought, and she knew that things don&#x2019;t work out the way you think they will far more often than you would like to believe. Sure, the pieces of paper we trade are linked, albeit loosely, to the underlying entities that issued them, but in her eyes it was always important to recognize that everyone, from the media to veteran Wall Streeters, places too much importance on this linkage, which is frequently severed by rumors, by larger market forces, and, of course, by short-term imbalances in supply and demand&#x2014;all of which can be gamed effectively. Occasionally stock prices are linked irrationally to the high side, as in Japan in 1988&#x2013;89 or in this country in 2000, and just as occasionally they are linked to the low side, as in September 1982, when the great bull market began; in October 1987, after the stock market crash; and in October 2002, the most recent important bottom that is restoring wealth through equity appreciation in this country. Karen taught me to spot these tops and bottoms, formidable skills that I know I can teach you. I spend considerable time fleshing out those top- and bottom-calling skills in this text so you can do the same without me.<br> <br>The Trading Goddess also taught me the difference between investing and trading, and how not to confuse them. Karen was&#x2014;and I remain&#x2014;an opportunist, one who is not bound by any particular investing philosophy beyond the need to adjust to the vicissitudes of a turbulent market so you are not knocked out of the business before the good times return. Callers and e-mailers are always asking me if I am a trader or an investor. I always respond the same way: what a stupid and false dichotomy.<br> <br>In the interest of putting this question to rest forever, let me tell you up front why the trader/investor distinction makes no sense. This is not pro football, where you play offense or defense, where specialized skill sets predominate and no one is a generalist. Managing your own money is like playing hockey, where everybody has an opportunity to defend and to score and everybody is expected to take that opportunity. Sometimes stocks are making radical moves in days, as they did in the 1999&#x2013;2000 period, and you have to capture those moves. If you frowned on those opportunities because they were too &#x201c;trading oriented&#x201d; or because you only like to buy &#x201c;value,&#x201d; you might have missed some huge profits. If you stayed dogmatic, dug in your heels, and insisted on owning overvalued stocks that had already made great moves, you could give it all back. Both of these so-called &#x201c;strengths&#x201d; are actually weaknesses, inflexible weaknesses that will doom you to substantial losses at various points in the cycle.<br> <br>Critics of mine dwell on my bullishness in December 1999 and January and February of 2000, the peak of the last bull market, or the bubble, as some insist on calling it. But the leaps stocks were making in that contained time span have not been and may never be replicated again. In that market the goal was to make those trading gains and go home, as I did with my March 15, 2000, RealMoney.com piece saying to take things off the table, four days after the exact top in the NASDAQ. Rather than feeling guilty about some who stayed in too long, I prided myself in recognizing that the market had changed for the worse in the spring of 2000, after the greatest run of all time, and you had to switch direction, no matter what your previous pronouncements and beliefs had been. You had to stay flexible to be conservative, to be prudent, to be commonsensical and keep your gains. Wall Street gibberish about being &#x201c;in for the long term&#x201d; or &#x201c;only interested in stocks that trade for less than their growth rate or their book value&#x201d; is just plain recklessness. You have to be willing to change your mind and your direction. Nowhere in the commandments of investing is it written &#x201c;One shall not change one&#x2019;s mind even if it may be wrong.&#x201d; Businesses change, they become good, they go bad. Markets change, they become good, they go bad. You can&#x2019;t be blind to those changes without losing money or risking being blown out of the game. But you must swear to stay in no matter what. It&#x2019;s not flipflopping if you like WorldCom when the business is good and hate it when the business goes bad, even though I was accused mightily of flip-flopping, for example, when I tossed aside WorldCom in the $80s after owning it for more than five years. Had I not &#x201c;flip-flopped&#x201d; and booted the stock to kingdom come, I might have lost everything I had made in that stock and then some. You must roll with the punches of investing, bobbing and weaving when the underlying businesses falter or fade.<br> <br>We all like to think of ourselves as conservative investors, but one of the Trading Goddess&#x2019;s most endearing and enduring traits is to recognize when buying, instead of staying in cash, is a conservative strategy and when holding, instead of selling, is the riskiest strategy of all. We&#x2019;ll explore in another section the arsenal of both short- and long-term tools and of using the downside of the market to make money, because, again, that can be the most conservative style available.<br> <br>Most important, the Trading Goddess taught me to be unemotional and commonsensical about the direction of stock prices. While sports analogies help the business come alive, we can&#x2019;t root for stocks and stick with the home team. There is no home team. While dogma may pay in politics, it&#x2019;s a killer in stocks. While religion is important, hope and prayer are best left elsewhere when it comes to your money. They aren&#x2019;t valid here. While science has made tremendous strides in hundreds of areas of life, the stock market is not a science. It is just a humbling collection of pricing decisions involving the supply of equities and a level of demand mitigated by greed and fear, two animalistic, psychological components. Those who try to quantify it, measure it, and use mathematical formulas to tame it will in the end be chewed up and eaten by it, as the biggest gang of Nobels under one roof, Long-Term Capital Management, a moronically reckless hedge fund, showed when it lost billions and went belly-up in 1998. There are forces and emotions that determine how markets function that are not susceptible to academic logic. Often to figure out how that market is valuing things we have to go outside the balance sheet and income statements, because the emotions of the market can blind you if you are constrained by those. If we simply limit the debate over how stocks get valued to price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book valuations (don&#x2019;t freak out, I&#x2019;ll explain those, too, in a way that you will at last understand), the market will often seem completely and utterly full of baloney and impossible to understand. But I will teach you how to make sense of all the markets we have seen, how to understand the underlying patterns, and how to know when to avoid stocks or to short them, and to know when the sages and pundits simply can&#x2019;t be trusted when they say, &#x201c;Stay away, the market&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d; In still another ...</p><h2>Enemies: A History of the FBI</h2><p><b>The hidden history of the FBI and its hundred-year war against terrorists, spies, and anyone it deemed subversive&#x2014;including even American presidents.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER �&nbsp;NOW A SHOWTIME ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY SERIES</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;Turns the long history of the FBI into a story that is as compelling, and important, as today&#x2019;s headlines.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jeffrey Toobin, author of&nbsp;<i>American Heiress</i></b><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Enemies</i>&nbsp;is the first definitive history of the FBI&#x2019;s secret intelligence operations, from an author whose work on the Pentagon and the CIA won him the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.<br>&nbsp;<br>We think of the FBI as America&#x2019;s police force.

The first waves of her troops were landing in France, unprepared for the horrors that faced them. On the home front, Americans were gripped by the fear of sabotage by German secret agents. The country had been on high alert for a year, ever since an enemy attack on a huge warehouse of American munitions bound for the battlefront. The blast at Black Tom Island, on the western edge of New York Harbor, had set off two thousand tons of explosives in the dark of a midsummer night. Seven people died at the site. In Manhattan, thousands of windows were shattered by the shock waves. The Statue of Liberty was scarred by shrapnel.<br><br>Hoover worked for the War Emergency Division at the Justice Department, charged with preventing the next surprise attack. He displayed a martial spirit and a knack for shaping the thinking of his superiors. He won praise from the division&#x2019;s chief, John Lord O&#x2019;Brian. &#x201c;He worked Sundays and nights, as I did,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brian recounted. &#x201c;I promoted him several times, simply on merits.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoover rose quickly to the top of the division&#x2019;s Alien Enemy Bureau, which was responsible for identifying and imprisoning politically suspect foreigners living in the United States. At the age of -twenty--three, Hoover oversaw 6,200 Germans who were interned in camps and 450,000 more who were under government surveillance. At -twenty--four, he was placed in charge of the newly created Radical Division of the Justice Department, and he ran the biggest counterterrorism operations in the history of the United States, rounding up thousands of radical suspects across the country. He had no guns or ammunition. Secret intelligence was his weapon.<br><br>Hoover lived all his life in Washington, D.C., where he was born on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1895, the youngest of four children. He was the son and the grandson of government servants. His father, Dickerson, was afflicted with depression; deep melancholy cost him his job as a government cartographer and likely hastened his death. His mother, Annie, was doting but dour. Hoover lived at home with her for the first -forty--three years of his life, until the day she died. He told several of his closest aides that he remained a single man because he feared the wrong woman would be his downfall; a bad marriage would destroy him. Hoover&#x2019;s niece, Margaret Fennell, grew up alongside him; she stayed in touch with him for six decades. She knew him as well as anyone could. &#x201c;I sometimes have thought that he -really&#x2014;-I don&#x2019;t know how to put -it&#x2014;-had a fear of becoming too personally involved with people,&#x201d; she reflected. If he ever expressed love beyond his devotion to God and country, there were no witnesses. He was sentimental about dogs, but unemotional about people. His inner life was a mystery, even to his immediate family and his few close friends.<br><br>Hoover learned how to march in military formation and how to make a formal argument. The drill team and the debate team at Central High School were the highlights of his youth. Central High&#x2019;s debate squad was the best in the city, and Hoover became one of its stars; his school newspaper praised his competitive spirit and his &#x201c;cool relentless logic.&#x201d; He told the paper, after a stirring victory over a college team, that debating had given him &#x201c;a practical and beneficial example of life, which is nothing more or less than the matching of one man&#x2019;s wit against another.&#x201d;<br><br>Hoover went to work for the government of the United States as soon as he had his high school diploma. Its monuments were all around him. His -two--story home sat six blocks southeast of Capitol Hill. At the crest of the hill stood the chandeliered chambers of the Senate and the House, the colossal temple of the Supreme Court, and the Library of Congress, with its vaulted ceilings and stained glass. Hoover dutifully recited the devotions of the Presbyterian Church on Sundays, but the Library of Congress was the secular cathedral of his youth. The library possessed every book published in the United States. The reverent hush of its central reading room imparted a sense that all knowledge was at hand, if you knew where to look. The library had its own system of classification, and Hoover learned its complexities as a cataloguer, earning money for school by filing and retrieving information. He worked days at the library while he studied in the early evenings and on summer mornings at George Washington University, where he earned his master&#x2019;s degree in law in June 1917. He registered for military service but joined the Justice Department to fight the war at home.<br>&#x201c;The gravest threats&#x201d;<br><br>On April 6, 1917, the day America entered World War I, President Woodrow W. Wilson signed executive orders giving the Justice Department the power to command the arrest and imprisonment, without trial, of any foreigner deemed disloyal. He told the American people that Germany had &#x201c;filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies, and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot.&#x201d; The president&#x2019;s words stoked fear across the country, and the fear placed a great weight on the Justice Department. &#x201c;When we declared war,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brian said, &#x201c;there were persons who expected to see a veritable reign of terror in America.&#x201d;<br><br>O&#x2019;Brian watched over Hoover and his colleagues as they labored day and night in cramped and smoky rooms at the War Emergency Division and the Alien Enemy Bureau, poring over fragmentary reports of plots against America. They were like firemen hearing the ceaseless ringing of false alarms. &#x201c;Immense pressure&#x201d; fell upon them, O&#x2019;Brian recalled; they faced demands from politicians and the public for the &#x201c;indiscriminate prosecution&#x201d; and &#x201c;wholesale repression&#x201d; of suspect Americans and aliens alike, often &#x201c;based on nothing more than irresponsible rumor.&#x201d; Before Black Tom, &#x201c;the people of this nation had no experience with subversive activities,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The government was likewise unprepared.&#x201d; After Black Tom, thousands of potential threats were reported to the government. American leaders feared the enemy could strike anywhere, at any time.<br><br>The German masterminds of Black Tom had been at work from the moment World War I began in Europe, in the summer of 1914. They had planned to infiltrate Washington and undermine Wall Street; they had enlisted Irish and Hindu nationalists to strike American targets; they had used Mexico and Canada as safe havens for covert operations against the United States. While Hoover was still studying law at night school, at the start of 1915, Germany&#x2019;s military attach� in the United States, Captain Franz von Papen, had received secret orders from Berlin: undermine America&#x2019;s will to fight. Von Papen began to build a propaganda machine in the United States; the Germans secretly gained control of a major New York newspaper, the Evening Mail; their front men negotiated to buy The Washington Post and the New York Sun. Political fixers, corrupt journalists, and crooked detectives served the German cause.<br><br>But after a German -U--boat torpedoed the British passenger ship Lusitania on May 7, 1915, killing 1,119 people, including 274 Americans, the German ambassador glumly cabled Berlin: &#x201c;We might as well admit openly that our propaganda here has collapsed completely.&#x201d; Americans were enraged at the attack on civilians; Germany&#x2019;s political and diplomatic status in the United States was grievously damaged. President Wilson ordered that all German embassy personnel in the United States be placed under surveillance. Secretary of State Robert Lansing sent secret agents to wiretap German diplomats. By year&#x2019;s end, von Papen and his fellow attach�s were expelled from the United States.<br><br>When Hoover arrived at the Justice Department, O&#x2019;Brian had just tried and convicted a German spy, Captain Franz von Rintelen. The case was -front--page news. Von Rintelen had arrived in New York a few weeks before the sinking of the Lusitania, carrying a forged Swiss passport. On orders from the German high command, he had recruited idle sailors on New York&#x2019;s docks, radical Irish nationalists, a Wall Street con artist, and a drunken Chicago congressman in plans to sabotage American war industries with a combination of business frauds and firebombs. But Captain von Rintelen had fled the United States, rightly fearing the exposure of his secret plans. British intelligence officers, who had been reading German cables, arrested him as he landed in -En-gland, roughly interrogated him in the Tower of London, and handed him over to the Justice Department for indictment and trial.<br><br>&#x201c;America never witnessed anything like this before,&#x201d; President Wilson told Congress after the captain&#x2019;s arrest. &#x201c;A little while ago, such a thing would have seemed incredible. Because it was incredible we made no preparation for it.&#x201d;<br><br>Terrorists and anarchists represented &#x201c;the gravest threats against our national peace and safety,&#x201d; the president said. &#x201c;Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. . . . The hand of our power should close over them at once.&#x201d;<br>J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI would become the instruments of that power.</p><h2>AMC&#39;s Best Day Hikes Near Boston: Four-Season Guide to 60 of the Best Trails in Eastern Massachusetts</h2><p>Available for the first time in vibrant full-color, this indispensable guide has been fully revised and updated to bring you 60 of the best day hikes in the Boston area.

Her grumpy neighbor, Rabbit, decides to build an even better one. <i>Rabbit &amp; Bear: Rabbit&#x2019;s Bad Habits</i> is full of laugh-out-loud moments and chronicles the forming of an unlikely friendship. With illustrations throughout, this chapter book is perfect for middle grade readers and is sure to become a fun favorite on any kid&#x2019;s bookshelf.</p><p><b>Julian Gough</b> is an award-winning novelist, playwright, poet, musician, and scriptwriter.

He is perhaps best known for drawing frogs on logs in the bestselling <i>Oi Frog</i>. He likes playing the guitar and drinking coffee.A laugh-out-loud celebration of friendship, forest life...and poo., <i>Metro</i><br><br>This beginning chapter book is delightfully weird, hilarious, and tender-hearted!, <i>Imagination Soup</i><br><br>A bear's kindness and generosity sweeten a grumpy rabbit's sour outlook in this wintry woodland encounter. Gough aims both high and low. On the one hand, he shows how the peaceable responses of Bear, equanimity unshaken despite discovering that her food stores have disappeared, to Rabbit's rude comments and behavior gradually work a profound change in his character&#x2014;and on the other, in the course of their exchanges, he has the long-eared lagomorph deliver a clinically explicit, hilariously extended disquisition on why his kind eats its own poo. Bear goes even further, saving Rabbit from an attacking wolf and then, when he shamefacedly produces the food that he had (yes) stolen earlier, inviting him to join her for a moonlit picnic and a snuggle in her cozy den. The narrative, laid out in short, well-leaded lines, likewise snuggles on every page with Field's duotone cartoon scenes of the two furry figures meeting, parting, starting separate snowmen but ultimately coming together to finish one, and finally sharing a honeycomb and other goodies before bedding down in the warm den. When, showing a newly awakened sense of compassion, Rabbit wonders if the snowman is lonely, Bear has the perfect solution: "In the morning," she murmurs drowsily, "we can make him a friend." Young readers will come away with fresh insights into both poo and peacemaking. (Animal fantasy. 6-8) -- Starred Review, <i>Kirkus</i><br><br><i>Rabbit's Bad Habits</i> is a breath of fresh air in children&#x2019;s fiction, a laugh-out-loud story of rabbit and wolf and bear, of avalanches and snowmen.

She first studied landscape architecture in school but later decided to earn a graduate degree in teaching. Lauren now builds city streets and house dragons in her basement in Madison, Wisconsin. <i>Claymates</i> is her debut picture book.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;After an artist leaves, two hunks of talking clay begin molding themselves, testing the limits of their physical forms and their imaginations. The gray blob, originally designed as a wolf, goes from an elephant to a snout-nosed "Pig-e-phant," while the brown blob, sculpted to be an owl, turns into everything from a peanut to a walrus. The two continue to stretch and bend into different forms and animals until they hear their artist coming. But how are they going to change themselves back?! Petty, author of I Don't Want To Be a Frog, has written another wonderfully humorous story, but this one embraces the characters' desire to shape their own identities. The clay lumps play off each other well, quickly escalating the situation until it hilariously spins out of control. But the real star may be Eldridge's models, since this title is not drawn but rather told through a series of photos of actual clay figures. Each design is vividly detailed and expressive; the characters clearly revel in the challenge and are excited by each transfiguration, and the look of panic on their faces as they try to change back is priceless. VERDICT Another win for Petty and a great debut for Eldridge.

Kaylee's failure to thrive is being monitored by an unsupportive doctor, and Anna's mother is frantic about the child's low weight and resistance to food. Even Grandma Wang's herbs do not entice her to eat. Meanwhile, Anna cannot think of an original science project that "really matters" until she and her Chinese friend Camille stumble upon something. As Camille sings a Chinese song, Kaylee seems mesmerized and eats more than usual. Anna and her project partners design a controlled experiment that proves their hypothesis: listening to songs, especially those in Chinese, encourages Kaylee to eat. And indeed, she gains nearly a pound. The experiment is entered in the town-wide science fair. Anna learns to appreciate the wisdom of Camille, who struggles academically but possesses a serene emotional intelligence. This book deals deftly with a range of thorny adoption- and ethnic-stereotyping issues, such as the abandonment of female Chinese infants and the assumption that all Asians are gifted students, and it has special meaning for families touched by adoption. The delicate black-and-white drawings scattered throughout the straightforward text help make this a good choice for readers new to chapter books, and it will appeal to fluent readers looking for a compelling story.-Deborah Vose, Highlands Elementary School, Braintree, MA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Garland, Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justice Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor) gives us an engaging and alarming book that aims to vindicate the rights of public school stu�dents, which have so often been undermined by the Supreme Court in recent decades. <br>&nbsp;<br>Judicial decisions assessing the constitutional rights of students in the nation&#x2019;s public schools have consistently generated bitter controversy. From racial segregation to un�authorized immigration, from antiwar protests to compul�sory flag salutes, from economic inequality to teacher-led prayer&#x2014;these are but a few of the cultural anxieties dividing American society that the Supreme Court has addressed in elementary and secondary schools. <i>The Schoolhouse Gate </i>gives a fresh, lucid, and provocative account of the historic legal battles waged over education and illuminates contemporary disputes that continue to fracture the nation. <br>&nbsp;<br>Justin Driver maintains that since the 1970s the Supreme Court has regularly abdicated its responsibility for protecting students&#x2019; constitutional rights and risked trans�forming public schools into Constitution-free zones. Students deriving lessons about citizenship from the Court&#x2019;s decisions in recent decades would conclude that the following actions taken by educators pass constitutional muster: inflicting severe corporal punishment on students without any proce�dural protections, searching students and their possessions without probable cause in bids to uncover violations of school rules, random drug testing of students who are not suspected of wrongdoing, and suppressing student speech for the view�point it espouses. Taking their cue from such decisions, lower courts have upheld a wide array of dubious school actions, including degrading strip searches, repressive dress codes, draconian &#x201c;zero tolerance&#x201d; disciplinary policies, and severe restrictions on off-campus speech. <br>&nbsp;<br>Driver surveys this legal landscape with eloquence, highlights the gripping personal narratives behind landmark clashes, and warns that the repeated failure to honor students&#x2019; rights threatens our basic constitutional order. This magiste�rial book will make it impossible to view American schools&#x2014;or America itself&#x2014;in the same way again. <i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>JUSTIN DRIVER</b> is Professor of Law at Yale Law School.

It would have been difficult to envision a more stately location for the gathering, as the property called Seven Springs Farm contained one thousand acres of land and a nearly thirty-�thousand-�square-�foot Georgian mansion, boasting some fourteen bedrooms, three swimming pools, two servants&#x2019; quarters, and its own elevator. Despite this grand setting, the pre-�wedding luncheon proved anything but festive. Instead, what began as an engaging discussion rapidly descended into a ferocious dispute, with several members of the wedding party&#x2014;�including both bride and groom&#x2014;�excoriating Justice Felix Frankfurter for an opinion that he issued on behalf of the U.S. Supreme Court only two days earlier. Frankfurter&#x2014;�who prior to joining the Court had been a legendary professor at Harvard Law School, where he was also Philip Graham&#x2019;s beloved mentor&#x2014;�usually relished nothing more than vigorous, even combative intellectual exchange. Indeed, <i>The New York Times</i> would remember Frankfurter as &#x201c;the greatest talker of his time&#x201d; and noted, &#x201c;He loved to argue, his head darting here and there, his hand suddenly gripping the listener&#x2019;s elbow as he made a point.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Mount Kisco, however, the silver-�tongued Frankfurter received more than he could handle. Even close to six decades after the incident, the ugly scene at Seven Springs remained with Katharine Graham, as she recalled in her memoir, <i>Personal History:</i> &#x201c;Felix loved and encouraged loud and violent arguments, which everyone usually enjoyed, but this time the argument went over the edge into bitter passion.&#x201d; Those in attendance reviled Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion as &#x201c;deeply disturb[ing]&#x201d; and &#x201c;shock[ing],&#x201d; she noted. The debate grew so intense, so strained that the groom&#x2019;s best man dissolved into emotion as he emitted not merely discreet sniffles, but full-�fledged waterworks&#x2014;shedding &#x201c;great large tears&#x201d; that he permitted to stream down his crimson cheeks. Frankfurter gamely sought to defend his view, but the onslaught provoked the justice to lose his composure, exclaiming that he would never again discuss judicial business in social settings. Katharine Graham recollected that &#x201c;[t]he argument went on and on,&#x201d; persisting so long, in fact, that they inadvertently kept the Lutheran minister waiting to perform the ceremony for more than an hour. The row did not finally dissipate, she noted, until Frankfurter &#x201c;grabb[ed] [her] arm with his always iron hand and [said], &#x2018;Come along, Kay. We will go for a walk in the woods and calm down.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>What legal decision elicited this acrimony on such an improbable occasion? The underlying dispute dated back five years, to a community located roughly two hundred miles southwest of Seven Springs but whose reality stood much further removed still from the heights of Mount Kisco&#x2019;s rarefied air&#x2014;�in the valleys of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s coal country. On October 22, 1935, in a small town suitably, if unimaginatively, called Minersville, a ten-�year-�old public school student named William Gobitis refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance along with his fifth-�grade classmates. When Gobitis&#x2019;s teacher noticed that he had not joined the others in saluting the American flag, she marched right over and tried to force his arm into the proper position. But Gobitis managed to resist her entreaties, locking his arm into place, with his right hand clutching his pocket. In response, Minersville&#x2019;s notoriously austere school superintendent, Charles Roudabush, contacted state education officials to ensure that he possessed the authority to expel Gobitis for this brazen act of insubordination. It made no difference to Roudabush that Gobitis attributed his unwillingness to recite the pledge to his faith as a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness. As Gobitis subsequently explained in a letter to the school board, he&#x2014;�and many other Witnesses, including his older sister Lillian&#x2014;�interpreted Exodus&#x2019;s prohibition on worshipping graven images to preclude participation in the ritual. &#x201c;I do not salute the flag not because I do not love my country,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;but [because] I love God more and I must obey His commandments.&#x201d; Despite the claim that the pledge requirement interfered with the Witnesses&#x2019; right to free exercise of religion protected by the Constitution&#x2019;s First Amendment, Roudabush nevertheless expelled the Gobitises, ordering them not to return until they were prepared to salute Old Glory.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although two lower federal courts vindicated the family&#x2019;s claim, Justice Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion for the Court in <i>Minersville School District v. Gobitis</i> maintained that expelling Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses for refusing to recite the pledge did not violate the First Amendment. Portions of Justice Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion, in the 8&#x2013;�1 decision, extolled the unifying potential of requiring students around the nation to honor the American flag. &#x201c;We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values,&#x201d; Frankfurter proclaimed. &#x201c;National unity is the basis of national security. . . . The flag is the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal differences, however large, within the framework of the Constitution.&#x201d; Ultimately, however, Frankfurter&#x2019;s reasoning in <i>Gobitis</i> hinged not on the appeal of patriotism but on the overarching principle that it would be improper for the judiciary to reach into public schools, overturning educators&#x2019; independent decisions. &#x201c;The wisdom of training children in patriotic impulses by . . . compulsions which necessarily pervade so much of the educational process is not for our independent judgment,&#x201d; Frankfurter warned in a critical passage. &#x201c;[T]he courtroom is not the arena for debating issues of educational policy. . . . So to hold would in effect make us the school board for the country.&#x201d; The negative consequences of vindicating the Gobitises&#x2019; constitutional challenge in this instance ought not be overlooked, Frankfurter insisted, for invalidating Minersville&#x2019;s expulsions would undermine &#x201c;the authorities in a thousand counties and school districts of this country,&#x201d; amounting to the imposition of &#x201c;pedagogical and psychological dogma in a field where courts possess no marked and certainly no controlling competence.&#x201d; <i>Gobitis</i> concluded, in sum, that judges should mind their own business, and leave educators to the business of molding American minds.<br>&nbsp;<br>In Minersville, news of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decision stunned the Gobitises. After hearing a radio broadcaster announce the adverse outcome, Lillian and her mother sat speechless in their kitchen for several minutes, paralyzed in disbelief. Their refusal to pledge had long ago transformed the Gobitis children into town pariahs, with peers flinging stones in their direction and sometimes shouting, &#x201c;Here comes Jehovah!&#x201d; The family&#x2019;s successive victories in lower courts caused them to dismiss any concern that the Supreme Court would not also redeem their sacrifices. &#x201c;It never really occurred to us that the Court&#x2019;s decision would be anything but favorable,&#x201d; Lillian recalled. Yet the Court&#x2019;s rejection hardly signaled the end of their ordeal. Shortly after the decision, a close friend called to warn the Gobitises that vigilantes planned to destroy their family-�owned grocery store if they persisted in refusing to salute the flag. Fearing violence, the Gobitis parents hastily arranged for their children to relocate to a safe house, and contacted law enforcement to protect the family&#x2019;s modest business. Although a state police cruiser parked outside the store evidently deterred the plot for physical destruction, Minersville&#x2019;s anti-�Gobitis contingent soon alighted upon an alternate strategy of damaging the business: a boycott. This economic approach gained enough adherents to inflict serious financial distress on the Gobitises, who were forced to borrow money from relatives simply to pay their mortgage.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Gobitises were far from the only members of their faith to suffer in the aftermath of Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion, as many contemporaneous observers connected a surge of anti-�Witness violence to the Court&#x2019;s legitimation of student salute requirements. The opinion arrived at an especially fraught political moment in American history as patriotic fervor reached a crescendo due to widespread fears that the nation would soon enter World War II. One day before <i>Gobitis</i> appeared, a Gallup poll revealed that 65 percent of Americans anticipated that Germany would attack the United States imminently. American flags sold so briskly during the month of the decision that leading outlets in New York City could not keep the item stocked. Given this frenzied environment, it should hardly be surprising that post-�<i>Gobitis</i> the practice of expelling Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness students for refusing to salute spread dramatically throughout the country. When the Court issued <i>Gobitis,</i> students in fifteen states either had been or were in the process of being expelled due to the saluting controversy. Just three years later, schools had expelled students in every one of the nation&#x2019;s forty-�eight states, totaling approximately two thousand students, virtually all of whom were Witnesses. Some jurisdictions, moreover, followed up on the expulsions by prosecuting Witness parents for contributing to the delinquency of minors, asserting that their children violated compulsory school attendance laws.<br>&nbsp;<br>While <i>Gobitis</i> enjoyed approval in much of the country, the media overwhelmingly reviled the opinion, as more than 170 newspapers condemned the opinion, and only a handful of publications praised it. For present purposes, however, the most remarkable aspect of that reaction was that no single passage in <i>Gobitis</i> drew more ire than Frankfurter&#x2019;s assertion that had the Court invalidated Minersville&#x2019;s salute requirement, it would have succeeded in transforming the Supreme Court into a national school board. This dismissive sentiment especially rankled periodicals concerned with religious autonomy. Thus, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> seized upon Frankfurter&#x2019;s line to suggest that <i>Gobitis</i> &#x201c;has . . . taken a step toward abdicating [the Court&#x2019;s] position as a constitutional guarantor of freedom of worship.&#x201d; Similarly, in an editorial titled &#x201c;The Court Abdicates,&#x201d; <i>The Christian Century</i> insisted that &#x201c;a question of educational policy may also be a question of fundamental rights,&#x201d; and noted that &#x201c;[c]ourts that will not protect even Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses will not long protect anybody.&#x201d; Paul Blakely&#x2014;�writing in the Jesuit magazine <i>America</i>&#x2014;�also contended that <i>Gobitis</i>&#x2019;s avowed withdrawal from the educational domain succeeded in making school boards all-�powerful. &#x201c;What further restrictions upon the right of parents to direct the education of their children will the States impose?,&#x201d; Blakely lamented. &#x201c;We do not know; all we know is that these are hysterical days, and that objectors will find no protection in the Supreme Court.&#x201d;</p><h2>Jaden Toussaint, the Greatest Episode 5: Mission Star-Power</h2><p>Giant Afro.

Treacherous court politics, poisonings, inter-national espionage, and adultery form the background to a story that includes such celebrated figures as Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots, and Nostradamus. <i>The Rival Queens</i> is a dangerous tale of love, betrayal, ambition, and the true nature of courage, the echoes of which still resonate.</p><p><b>Nancy Goldstone</b>'s previous books include <em>The Maid and the Queen: The Secret History of Joan of Arc; Four Queens: The Proven�al Sisters Who Ruled Europe</em>;<em> </em>and <em>The Lady Queen: The Notorious Reign of Joanna I, Queen of Naples, Jerusalem, and Sicily</em>.

In the late 1970s the Emerson Rose Asylum became completely abandoned - all the patients, doctors, staff, vanished and were never seen again. The events circling this mass exodus have been one of the most baffling disappearances in history. Until now. A stack of bundled letters was found inside a tattered asylum mattress during the Emerson demolition. These letters, all addressed to the pseudonym Dr. Quill, were written by the patients as they documented the demise of the Emerson Rose Asylum. The patients innocently convey their dire pasts while the events occurring hint toward dark happenings outside their doors. Haunting, their words conjure feelings both grim and promising, as they secretly conjure a plan of mass exodus from the volatile institution. The names have been changed, but the stories have not. Though their identities are protected, the essence of these patients&#x2019; challenges, triumphs, corruptions, salvations, and most of all, their human spirit, remains untouched.

The Jazz Harmony Book is a course in how to add chords to melodies, showing how a single melody can give rise to rich harmonic variations. Endorsed by Kenny Werner, Fred Hersch, Mark Levine, and others, this book fills a big gap in the jazz literature and will be used by generations of jazz musicians to learn both the basics and subtleties of Jazz Harmony. Includes two CDs.</p><p>David Berkman is one of the top jazz pianists in New York with seven records out under his own name. He has performed or recorded with countless jazz stars including Sonny Stitt, Joe Lovano, Eddie Henderson, Brian Blade,Dave Douglas, Chris Potter, etc. An in-demand jazz educator on three continents, he is an associate professor of music at Queens College in NY.This is a definitive study of harmony from someone who knows harmony. The Jazz Harmony Book is a great way for musicians to completely understand and implement harmony in their music. He makes a great point that jazz has evolved mostly rhythmically. And while he pays full tribute to rhythm and the excitement of this modern music, he makes the very true point that while rhythm has evolved, harmony in modern music seems to have devolved. Perhaps if up-and-coming jazz musicians follow David s insightful path to harmony, that might change! KENNY WERNER --Private correspondence<br><br>This book is very comprehensive and well-organized and one of the better books I have seen on this subject. The Tips for Composers alone are worth the price of the book. FRED HERSCH --Private correspondence<br><br>Since David Berkman was appointed to the Aaron Copland School at Queens College, the difference in the level of sophistication of our graduates in both performing and composing has been tremendous. Musicians get much more value from all of our courses because of the understanding they gain from the material contained in this book. When musicians understand harmony they hear more detail in the music and can participate at a much higher level. David has a gift for explaining complex ideas and guiding musicians along the path of learning jazz harmony. This book is invaluable!

As her son and as an experienced psychotherapist I discovered the secret who Alice Miller really was. My mother always cared that nothing of her private life got public. She created a fictional character in her books and in mine she gets a real person, a man of flesh and blood. It&#x2019;s also my history because I describe, how it is when you are faced, as a child and in second generation, with the not coped post-war trauma of your parents. Alice Miller created a mother image in her books she never complied. My book shows what happens when you do not overcome your traumas and you pass them on the next generation.

Hunger strikes, riots, power cuts, a homophobic serial killer with a penchant for opera, and a young woman&#x2019;s suicide that may yet turn out to be murder: on the surface, the events are unconnected, but then things&#x2014;and people&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t always what they seem. Detective Sergeant Duffy is the man tasked with trying to get to the bottom of it all. It&#x2019;s no easy job&#x2014;especially when it turns out that one of the victims was involved in the IRA but was last seen discussing business with someone from the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force. Add to this the fact that, as a Catholic policeman, it doesn&#x2019;t matter which side he&#x2019;s on, because nobody trusts him, and Sergeant Duffy really is in a no-win situation. Fast-paced, evocative, and brutal, <em>The Cold Cold Ground</em> is a brilliant depiction of Belfast at the height of the Troubles&#x2014;and of a cop treading a thin, thin line.</p></p><p><p><b>Adrian McKinty </b>was born and grew up in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He attended Oxford University on a full scholarship where he studied philosophy.

In 2004 Adrian's debut crime novel, <i>Dead I Well May Be</i>, was shortlisted for the Dagger Award and was optioned by Universal Pictures. Since then his books have sold over half a million copies and been translated into a dozen languages. Adrian won the 2017 Edgar Award and is a two time winner of the Ned Kelly Award and the Barry Award.</p><p>"<i>The Cold Cold Ground</i> is a razor-sharp thriller set against the backdrop of a country in chaos, told with style, courage, and dark-as-night wit.

The important crime fiction ones are present and accounted for here--a serial killer who purposely leaves clues, a cop who's on to him, procedural and forensic nitty-gritty. Yet McKinty can startle with bouts of lyrical scene-setting that could only come from the fingertips of someone who grew up in the environment...Your reviewer was born the year <i>The Cold Cold Ground</i> is set in, and such passages work better at painting a picture than any episode of <i>Reeling in the Years</i>."</p>-- "Irish Sunday Independent (Dublin)"<br><br><p>"Written in a terse style, the novel is a literary thriller that is as concerned with exploring the poisonously claustrophobic demi-monde of Northern Ireland during the Troubles and the self-sabotaging contradictions of its place and time as it is with providing the genre's conventional thrills and spills. The result is a masterpiece of Troubles crime fiction: had David Peace, Eoin McNamee, and Brian Moore sat down to brew up the great Troubles novel, they would have been very pleased indeed to have written <i>The Cold Cold Ground</i>."</p>-- "Irish Times (Dublin)"<br><br><p>"No question, <i>The Cold Cold Ground</i> is an exciting launch for what is sure to be an anticipated crime series. Great detective stories are built on three key elements--setting, story, and protagonist--and this one deploys each one magnificently. The setting--Northern Ireland in 1981, during the hunger strikes--is portrayed with frightening detail. The clever story evolves slowly as plot points are pinned to cultural biases that transcend "The Troubles"--for example, homosexuality and unwed motherhood. Police detective Sean Duffy wins us over chapter by chapter with his tenacity; his swaggering, witty dialogue; and his record collection--he spins The Velvet Underground when in need of a lift. The audiobook exceeds all expectations because of narrator Gerard Doyle. His storytelling is understated, and his dialect work is remarkable. This is the ninth collaboration between author and narrator, and this team totally rocks.

Today most people believe that African people never voyaged outside Africa except as slaves. This is false, the Dafuna boat discovered in Nigeria dates back to 12,000 BC. And hundreds of ancient African boats have been engraved on rocks in the Sahara desert. Boats from Magan (Egypt) and Meluhha (Kush-East Africa) are mentioned in Sumerian cuneiform text. In this book you will discover that Africans have a long tradition of sea exploration and founded many of the major American civilizations. Although many people have heard about the possible discovery of America by Mansa Abubakari of the Mali Empire, and the giant Olmec heads of Mexico, Dr. Clyde Winters gives a detailed account of the Malian colonies established by these West Africans in North America and Brazil. You will discover the role of the Xi, or Olmec people as the Mother Culture of Mexico. Dr. Winters outlines the Axumite discovery of America, and the role of the Ethiopians in the rise of Mochica civilization and religion. In addition, this book discusses the ancient Sumerian influence in South America, and the African role as Mound Builders in the United States. African Empires in Ancient America is the only book that finally explores the history of Black colonization of the Americas before Columbus.

Hesse concentrated on writing poetry as a young man, but his first successful book was a novel, Peter Camenzind (1904). During the war, Hesse was actively involved in relief efforts. Depression, criticism for his pacifist views, and a series of personal crises led Hesse to undergo psychoanalysis with J. B. Lang. Out of these years came Demian (1919), a novel whose main character is torn between the orderliness of bourgeois existence and the turbulent and enticing world of sensual experience. This dichotomy is prominent in Hesse&#39;s subsequent novels, including Siddhartha (1922), Steppenwolf (1927), and Narcissus and Goldmund (1930). Hesse worked on his magnum opus, The Glass Bead Game (1943), for twelve years. This novel was specifically cited when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Hesse died at his home in Switzerland in 1962.The gripping and fascinating story of disease in a man&#39;s soul * The New York Times *</p><h2>Mercies in Disguise: A Story of Hope, a Family&#39;s Genetic Destiny, and the Science That Rescued Them</h2><p><p><b>"...a moving, suspenseful page-turner that's likely to become a classic of medical storytelling." &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><i></i><br><i>New York Times</i> science reporter Gina Kolata follows a family through genetic illness and one courageous daughter who decides her fate shall no longer be decided by a genetic flaw.</p><p>The phone rings.

Written in the mid 1800s by the rather eccentric Sabine Baring-Gould, it covers more than 1,000 years of lore from a half dozen paths- the berserker of Norse lore, French mythology, and then-modern anecdotes of cannibalism and madness. Not relegating the werewolf just to a secular and skeptical study, nor simply to spiritual banter, Baring-Gould manages to compress an enormous span of historical material into his work; a work which is no doubt of value to the academic and those involved with the occult at the same time.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b> <br><br>"The Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould (28 January 1834 - 2 January 1924) was an English hagiographer, antiquarian, novelist and eclectic scholar. His bibliography lists more than 500 separate publications. His family home, Lewtrenchard Manor near Okehampton, Devon, has been preserved as he rebuilt it and is now a hotel. He is remembered particularly as a writer of hymns, the best-known being "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "Now the Day Is Over", and the desk at which he wrote these hymns is still preserved at the hotel. He also translated the carol "Gabriel's Message" from Basque to English.<br><br>His education at The King's School, Warwick lasted just a few months in 1846 - he caught whooping-cough and was ordered to go abroad for the sake of his health. He then went up to Cambridge earning the degrees of B.A. in 1857, then M.A. in 1860 from Clare College." <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i></p><h2>Sweep of the Blade (Innkeeper Chronicles)</h2><p>Maud Demille is a daughter of Innkeepers&#x2014;a special group who provide &#x2018;lodging&#x2019; to other-planetary visitors&#x2014;so she knows that a simple life isn't in the cards.

They were the odd couple of the art world -- one calm, the other volatile -- and the denouement of their living arrangement was explosive. Making use of new evidence and Van Gogh&#x2019;s voluminous correspondence, Martin Gayford describes not only how these two hallowed artists painted and exchanged ideas, but also the texture of their everyday lives. Gayford also makes a persuasive analysis of Van Gogh&#x2019;s mental illness -- the probable bipolar affliction that led him to commit suicide at the age of thirty-seven. The Yellow House is a singular biographical work, as dramatic and vibrant as the work of these brilliant artists.</p><p>Martin Gayford was educated at Cambridge University and the Courtauld Institute of the University of London. He is the coeditor of The Grove Book of Art Writing and was the chief art critic for Bloomberg Europe. Gayford lives in Cambridge, England.<i>Starred Review.</i> Van Gogh's reputation in the public imagination has been made as much by his descent into madness as by his art. Detailing the final year of his life and the "Studio of the South" in which Gauguin and Van Gogh painted side by side, Gayford brings the art back into focus. Explications of the works illuminate the collaboration&#x2014;similar subjects find very different treatment by two entirely different temperaments. Yet their influence on each other is everywhere&#x2014;a story that Van Gogh recommends to Gauguin finds its way into a painting; Van Gogh uses the jute canvas that is Gauguin's material of choice. While some of this is well-trodden territory, Gayford's narrative is genuinely dramatic as it moves toward Van Gogh's fateful end. Gayford makes exciting new connections between the tone of Van Gogh's correspondence and known scholarship about his probable bipolar disorder. The influences of literature, the news media and so-called "hygienic excursions" (visits to the local brothels) percolate in these letters and under the surfaces of the artists' canvases. So, argues Gayford, were they invading Van Gogh's mind. Though it is impossible to entirely understand what motivated these two great artists during their weeks together in Arles, these pages deliver as close and vivid an image as may be possible. 60 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Nov. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you&#39;ve seen the movie, don&#39;t miss this companion book that will inspire you with hope of help from above. (Revised, updated, and expanded version of the book &#34;When Angels Intervene To Save The Children&#34;.)</p><p>Hartt Wixom has been writing about angling for more than four decades. During that time, he has had more than a hundred articles published on fishing in such magazines as Outdoor Life, Field and Stream (five years a field editor), Sports Afield, Western Outdoors, American Angler, Southwestern Fly Fishing, and Salmon-Trout-Steelheader. He has been an outdoor writer and editor for several western newspapers, including three Utah dailies: Deseret Morning News, Daily Herald, and St. George Spectrum. Hartt and his wife, Judene, live in Ivins, Utah, and Cokeville, Wyoming.

Christensen film (three times to date) to get some more depth about what took place and the testimonies of the parents and children who went through the harrowing experience. I found the book to be fascinating and it made my positive impressions for the even stronger. The film is an accurate account of what took place that day.

Some of these works, called "Apocrypha" by Protestants and "Deuteron-canonical Works" by Roman Catholics are expertly and attractively collected in The Apocrypha: The Lutheran Edition with Notes. In these writings you will find a deep expression of the need for God's forgiveness (the Prayer of Manasseh) and a vision of the future with the coming of the Messiah (2 Esdras or Ezra Apocalypse = 4 Ezra). The introductions are superbly well written and engaging. One can see how the Apocrypha ... bridges the "Old" Testament with the "New" Testament. Highly recommended, as Athanasius said in 367 "for instruction in the word of godliness."<br> --James H. Charlesworth<br> Director and Editor, Princeton Dead Sea Scrolls Project<br> George L. Collord Professor of New Testament Language and Literature <br> Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey<br> This book provides a well-balanced blend of sound scholarship and religious beliefs on the Apocrypha, especially those of Luther and the Lutherans. The reader will find all the necessary background information on the Apocrypha in an attractive presentation, as well as religious guidance for instruction and preaching. A wealth of introductory essays and appendixes make this a very useful compendium. <br> --Prof. Emanuel Tov, PhD <br> J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible <br> Hebrew University, Jerusalem<br> I recommend this edition of the Apocrypha as a timely and useful addition to The Lutheran Study Bible. The Apocrypha have been considered as a part of the biblical canon for most of the church's history, and while the Reformers may have had good reasons for thinking differently, they still had a high regard for them. This edition enables both scholars and lay readers to understand why. <br> --Knut Alfsv�g, ThD<br>Professor of Systematic Theology<br><br> School of Mission and Theology, Stavanger, Norway<br> Luther recommended the Apocrypha as books that are not regarded as equal to the Holy Scripture, and yet are profitable and good to read. Lutheran piety up to now seems to have remembered just the first part of this statement and did not very often exercise itself in the profitable reading. This present edition gives us occasion to get a fresh approach to books like Wisdom of Solomon, Maccabees, and others. Accompanied with quotations mainly from Luther and John Gerhard, and useful explanations, the reader may gain a deeply spiritual approach to the Apocrypha and explore anew these treasures of the Lutheran faith! --Prof. Dr. Volker Leppin <br> Eberhard Karls University <br> Tuebingen, Germany<br><br>The books of the Apocrypha are absolutely essential for understanding the Jewish context of early Christianity.

Mark C. Chavez<br>General Secretary, North American Lutheran Church<br>Martin Luther commented that the Apocrypha "were not equal to scripture, yet useful and good to read." This volume helpfully guides the reader in exploring how and why this is so. Useful historical explanations, wisely chosen excerpts from the prefaces of the Apocryphal books by Luther and Gerhard, helpful textual explanations and charts, and wise advice on the challenges and blessings for readers make this edition of the Apocrypha shine. This is a delightful study resource and devotional guide to complement one's reading of Scripture. <br>--Rev. Gordon A. Jensen, PhD<br>William Hordern Professor of Theology<br>Lutheran Theological Seminary Saskatoon, Canada<br> One of the great rewards of biblical study is an increased awareness of the historical and cultural setting in which the Scriptures were written. In The Apocrypha: The Lutheran Edition with Notes, Editor Engelbrecht and his team of contributors have provided an attractive and accessible overview of one of the most interesting periods in the Bible's history, namely, the Intertestamental or Second Temple Period. It was during this time that the Old Testament was completed and the New Testament was on the threshold of emerging. Succinct introductions with helpful maps and diagrams enrich the presentation. A distinctive strength is the churchly and confessional assessment from a Lutheran perspective that provides a framework for the historical material--a significant contribution that lifts the reader beyond the merely academic.<br> --Rev. Dean O. Wenthe, PhD <br> General Editor, Concordia Commentary <br> Professor and President Emeritus,<br>Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne, Indiana<br> There recently has been a renewed interest in the Lutheran devotional writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this literature their use and interest in the Apocrypha is clearly evident. The devotional writers have a genuine appreciation of these books and especially for Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon. This is certainly in keeping with Luther's evaluation of the Apocrypha: "These books are not held equal to the Scriptures but are useful and good to read" (AE 35:337). Concordia is to be commended for this excellent Lutheran edition of the Apocrypha. The Apocrypha: The Lutheran Edition with Notes will definitely be edifying for twenty-first century Christians. --Gaylin R.

In my favorite poem by G.K.Chesterton,&nbsp;The Donkey, we learn that whatever low view the world has of us we are all exceptional: &#x201c;When fishes flew and forests walked. Some moment when the moon was blood.

Hall's masterpiece of symbolic philosophy, <b>The Secret Teachings of All Ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b> In <b>Lectures on Ancient Philosophy</b>, Manly P. Hall expands on the philosophical, metaphysical, and cosmological themes introduced in his classic work, <b>The Secret Teachings of All Ages</b>. Hall wrote this volume as a reader's companion to his earlier work, intending it for those wishing to delve more deeply into the esoteric philosophies and ideas that undergird the Secret Teachings. Particular attention is paid to Neoplatonism, ancient Christianity, Rosicrucian and Freemasonic traditions, ancient mysteries, pagan rites and symbols, and Pythagorean mathematics.<br>&nbsp;<br>First published in 1929-the year after the publication of Hall's magnum opus-this edition includes the author's original subject index, twenty diagrams prepared under his supervision for the volume, and his 1984 preface, which puts the book in context for the contemporary reader.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Manley P. Hall (1901-1990), widely regarded as a sage and teacher steeped in the wisdom of antiquity, was one of the leading esoteric scholars of the twentieth century. The author of the landmark work <b>The Secret Teachings of All Ages</b>, Hall was named a 33� Mason in 1973.

But Jesus Christ isn't a personal genie. He is the Savior. He died in agony to satisfy the wrath of a holy God and to forgive the sins of humankind. Faith in Him demands a willingness to make any sacrifice He asks. The hard truth about Christianity is that the cost is high, but the rewards are priceless: abundant and eternal life that comes only from faithfully follwing Christ.</p></p><p>JOHN F. MACARTHUR pastors Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, and serves as president of the Master&#39;s College and Seminary. A well-known Bible expositor and conference speaker, he has written more than six dozen books, including the MacArthur New Testament Commentary series and the MacArthur Study Bible. He is the Bible teacher on Grace to You, an international radio broadcast.<br> <b>CHAPTER ONE:</b> <br> <p> <b>Tastes Great, Less Filling</b></p> <p> The first role of successful merchandising is to give consumers what they want. If they want bigger burgers, make their burgers bigger. Designer bottled water in six fruit flavors? Done. Minivans with ten cup holders? Give them twenty. You&#x2019;ve got to keep the customer satisfied. You&#x2019;ve got to modify your product and your message to meet their needs if you want to build a market and get ahead of the competition.</p> <p> Today this same consumer mind-set has invaded Christianity. The church service is too long, you say? We&#x2019;ll shorten it (one pastor guarantees his sermons will never last more than seven minutes!). Too formal? Wear your sweatsuit. Too boring? Wait&#x2019;ll you hear our band!</p> <p> And if the message is too confrontational, or too judgmental, or too exclusive, scary, unbelievable, hard to understand, or too much anything else for your taste, churches everywhere are eager to adjust that message to make you more comfortable. This new version of Christianity makes you a partner on the team, a design consultant on church life, and does away with old-fashioned authority, guilt trips, accountability, and moral absolutes. </p> <p> One suburban church sent out a mailer recently, promising an &#x201c;informal, relaxed, casual atmosphere,&#x201d; &#x201c;great music from our band,&#x201d; and that those who come will, &#x201c;believe it or not, even have fun.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s all great if you&#x2019;re a coffee house. But anyone who claims to be calling people to the gospel of Jesus with those as his priorities is calling them to a lie. </p> <p> It&#x2019;s Christianity for consumers: Christianity Lite, the redirection, watering down, and misinterpretation of the biblical gospel in an attempt to make it more palatable and popular. It tastes great going down and settles light. It seems to salve your feelings and scratch your itch; it&#x2019;s custom tailored to your preferences. But that lightness will never fill you up with the true, saving gospel of Jesus Christ, because it is designed by man and not God, and it is hollow and worthless. In fact, it&#x2019;s worse than worthless, because people who hear the message of Christianity Lite think they&#x2019;re hearing the gospel&#x2014;think they&#x2019;re being rescued from eternal judgment&#x2014;when, in fact, they&#x2019;re being tragically misled. </p> <p><b>The False Gospel of Self-Esteem</b></p> <p> The true gospel is a call to self-denial. It is not a call to self-fulfillment. And that puts it in opposition to the contemporary evangelical gospel, where ministers view Jesus as a utilitarian genie. You rub the lamp, and He jumps out and says you have whatever you want; you give Him your list and He delivers. </p> <p> Defending the true gospel has put me in pretty serious opposition to folks who don&#x2019;t want to take the Bible seriously. I always say that the people I pastor at Grace Church must have a heart to submit to the Word of God, because that&#x2019;s the message they&#x2019;re going to get, unadorned and unadulterated, every time they walk through the door. If they&#x2019;re not willing to face the hard truth of conviction over their sins, the hard disturbing reality of self-denial and the hard demands of following Christ, they&#x2019;re not going to hang around very long. </p> <p> Some within the framework of evangelicalism will tell you Jesus just wants you well, and if you&#x2019;re not well, it&#x2019;s because you haven&#x2019;t turned in your spiritual lottery ticket. If you&#x2019;re not rich, it&#x2019;s because you haven&#x2019;t claimed it. Jesus wants you free from debt, and if you send the televangelists enough money, that act of faith will free you from the demon of debt. Your salvation through Christ is a guarantee of health, wealth, prosperity, and happiness. </p> <p> The psychologically man-centered evangelicals tell you that Jesus gives you peace, Jesus gives you joy, Jesus makes you a better salesman, and Jesus helps you hit more home runs. Jesus really wants to make you feel better about yourself. He wants to elevate your self-image. He wants to put an end to your negative thinking. </p> <p> It&#x2019;s interesting how this trend has come into the church. I&#x2019;ve been around long enough to have seen it arrive. It blossomed, I think, most pointedly through the effort of the ever present small screen religious personality Robert Schuller and a book he wrote a number of years ago called <i>Self-Esteem: The New Reformation</i>. I reviewed that book for a national magazine. I thought Schuller&#x2019;s view was a turning point, literally, as the title says, an attempt to promote a new reformation. It was an effort to replace the biblical gospel with a new gospel. And it worked. </p> <p> In that book, Robert Schuller attacked the protestant reformation. Calling for a new reformation he wrote: &#x201c;It is precisely at this point that classical theology has erred in its insistence that theology be &#x2018;God-centered&#x2019; and not &#x2018;man-centered.&#x2019;&#x201d; So, according to Schuller, the first thing we have to do is put an end to classical, God-centered theology and replace it with man-centered theology. </p> <p> To define man-centered theology (an oxymoron), he wrote further, �This master plan of God is designed around the deepest needs of human beings&#x2014;self-dignity, self-respect, self-worth, self-esteem.&#x201d; For Schuller, the pearl of great price is self-respect and self-esteem. He went on to say, &#x201c;Success is to be defined as the gift of self-esteem that God gives us as a reward for our sacrificial service in building self-esteem in others. Win or lose: If we follow God&#x2019;s plan as faithfully as we can, we will feel good about ourselves. That is success!&#x201d;</p> <p> Pardon me if I don&#x2019;t join. I can&#x2019;t think of a plan with which I&#x2019;d less like to associate. </p> <p> In this new reformation of self-esteem, the first thing required is to pull God down from His supremely elevated place so you can then lift yourself up, replacing God-exalting theology with man-exalting, self-esteem psychology. To pull this off requires altering and misinterpreting the Bible and the gospel for the grand purpose of making people feel better about themselves, so they can fulfill their dreams and realize their visions. </p> <p> Maybe the most amazing statement in <i>Self-Esteem: The New Reformation</i> is the following: &#x201c;Once a person believes he is an &#x2018;unworthy sinner,&#x2019; it is doubtful if he can really honestly accept the saving grace God offers in Jesus Christ.&#x201d; So, if you want to be saved, according to this new gospel you cannot believe yourself to be an unworthy sinner. How twisted is that? How contrary to the truth is that? But it is just the sort of man-centered, self-esteem gospel that eventually became the seeker-friendly movement, which has hijacked so many churches. It&#x2019;s a kind of quasi-Christian narcissism, or self-love, that is characteristic of false teachers: according to 2 Timothy 3, which reminds us, &#x201c;Dangerous times will come, for men will be lovers of themselves&#x201d; (see 2 Tim. 3:1-2). </p> <p> Christianity, in the hands of seeker-sensitive church leaders, has become a &#x201c;get what you want&#x201d; rather than a &#x201c;give up everything&#x201d; movement. These leaders have prostituted the divine intention of the gospel. They have replaced the glory of God with the satisfaction of man. They have traded the concept of abandoning our lives to the honor of Christ for Christ honoring us. As such, our submission to His will is replaced by His submission to our will. Since people usually reject the real gospel, modern evangelicals have simply changed the message. </p> <p> A saint of many centuries ago got it right with this prayer:</p> <p> &#x201c;Lord high and holy, meek and lowly, let me learn by paradox that the way down is the way up, that to be low is to be high, that the broken heart is the healed heart, that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit, that the repenting soul is the victorious soul, that to have nothing is to possess everything, that to bear the cross is to wear the crown, that to give is to receive. Let me find thy light in my darkness, thy joy in my sorrow, thy grace in my sin, thy riches in my poverty, thy glory in my valley, thy life in my death.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x201c;Thy life in my death&#x201d;? That&#x2019;s the true gospel. Jesus said it unmistakably and inescapably, &#x201c;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it&#x201d; (Matt. 16:24-25). It&#x2019;s not about exalting me, it&#x2019;s about <i>slaying</i> me. It&#x2019;s the death of self. You win by losing; you live by dying. And that is the heart message of the gospel. That is the essence of discipleship. </p> <p> The passage mentions nothing about improving your self-esteem, being rich and successful, feeling good about yourself, or having your felt needs met, which is what so many churches are preaching these days in order to sugarcoat the truth.</p> <p> So who&#x2019;s right? Is the message of Christianity self-fulfillment, or is it self-denial? It can&#x2019;t be both. If it&#x2019;s just a matter of opinion, I&#x2019;ll do my thing and you do yours, and we&#x2019;ll both cruise contentedly along in separate directions. But Christianity, the genuine gospel of Jesus Christ, is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of truth. What you want, or I want, or anybody else wants, makes no difference whatever. It is what it is&#x2014;by God&#x2019;s sovereign will. </p> <p> <b>The Hard Words of Jesus</b></p> <p> I have no idea how the fans of Christianity Lite reconcile their approach to religion with the teachings of Jesus, or how they become comfortable ignoring what He said. But the only acceptable approach&#x2014;for me and you&#x2014;is to take our Lord at His word in the single source of truth for every authentic Christian: the word of God revealed in the Bible. So let&#x2019;s go there. </p> <p> Luke 9 cuts to the core of the question of what Christianity is all about. Here, Jesus was with his disciples shortly after miraculously feeding a crowd of five thousand, who had come to hear him speak, with one modest basket of loaves and fishes. In Luke 9:23-26 we read:</p> <p> Then He said to them all, &#x201c;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost? For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father&#x2019;s, and of the holy angels.&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s pretty simple. Anyone who wants to come after Jesus into the kingdom of God&#x2014;anyone who wants to be a Christian&#x2014;has to face three commands: 1) deny himself, 2) take up his cross daily, and 3) follow Him. These words are hard to believe. They&#x2019;re not consumer-friendly or seeker-sensitive. Christianity Lite is nowhere to be found. But this is not an obscure passage, or something different from other teachings of Jesus. These are principles that He taught consistently and repeatedly throughout His ministry, over and over again in all different contexts.</p> <p> This is not news. When Martin Luther launched the Protestant Reformation in 1517 by posting his ninety-five theses on the door at Wittenberg, he affirmed in the fourth thesis that salvation required self-hate. He wrote that &#x201c;self-hate remains right up to entrance into the kingdom of heaven.&#x201d; The original Greek word for &#x201c;deny&#x201d; means &#x201c;to refuse to associate with.&#x201d; The thought is that if you want to be Christ&#x2019;s disciple, and receive forgiveness and eternal life, you must refuse to associate any longer with the person you are! You are sick of your sinful self and want nothing to do with you anymore. And it may mean not just you, but your family. </p> <p> In Matthew 10:32, Jesus talked about confessing Him as Lord and Savior: &#x201c;Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven.&#x201d; And then in verses 34-36: &#x201c;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and &#x2018;a man&#x2019;s enemies will be those of his own household.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p> It&#x2019;s not a friendly invitation; it&#x2019;s a warning: If you come to Christ, it may make your family worse, not better. It may send a rift into your family, the likes of which you have never experienced before. If you give your life to Jesus Christ, there will be an impassable gulf between you and people who don&#x2019;t give their lives to Him. In fact, as the New Age Hindu mystic Deepak Chopra said to me on CNN Television: &#x201c;You and I are in two different universes.&#x201d; I replied that he was exactly right. And that is not just true for strangers but also for family members, creating a severe breach in those most intimate of all relationships. </p> <p> Verse 37 adds, &#x201c;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re not willing to pay the price of a permanent split in your family unless your loved ones come to Christ&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re not willing to pay the price of greater trauma, greater conflict, greater suffering in your family&#x2014;then you&#x2019;re not worthy to be Jesus&#x2019; disciple.</p> <p> Verse 38: &#x201c;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.&#x201d; Wait a minute. In Jesus&#x2019; time, people associated a cross with one thing and one thing alone: a cross was an instrument of death. He was saying that if you&#x2019;re not willing to have conflict with the world to the degree that it could cost you your life, then you&#x2019;re not worthy of Him.</p> <p> Verse 39: &#x201c;He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.&#x201d; This is an echo of Luke 9. It&#x2019;s about losing your life. It&#x2019;s not a man-centered theology, it&#x2019;s a Christ-centered theology that says, &#x201c;I give everything to Christ, no matter what it costs me, even if it costs me my life.&#x201d; </p> <p> <b>The True Gospel of Scripture</b></p> <p> This is a bedrock truth of Christianity that the Bible confirms repeatedly. Jesus said the same thing in many different ways. He said it in the familiar story of the rich young ruler. In Mark 10:17 the young synagogue leader ran up to Jesus, knelt before Him, and asked, &#x201c;Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#x201d;</p> <p> What a setup for personal evangelism! Jesus could have said, &#x201c;Pray this prayer&#x201d; or &#x201c;Make a decision to accept Me!&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t. Instead He confronted the young man with the reality of sin to reveal whether he was convicted of his wickedness and penitent over his iniquities. Jesus offered several of the Ten Commandments as examples of the law of God the young man had broken. </p> <p> Rejecting any thought of sinfulness and repentance, the young man bragged about having obeyed the Ten Commandments all his life. He thought he was a perfect candidate for eternal life. But he got a response he didn&#x2019;t expect. In verse 21, Jesus said, &#x201c;Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.&#x201d; Jesus exposed his self-righteousness and then uncovered his love for money. The young ruler wanted Jesus to show him how to have eternal life. But Jesus told him that the price was giving up his illusion of self-righteousness, recognizing himself rather as an unworthy, wretched sinner. And he needed to be willing to submit to the Lord Jesus, even if it meant he had to give up all his earthly possessions. He might not ask, but the requirement for eternal life is the willingness to give it all up if He does. </p> <p> The young man wouldn&#x2019;t do either&#x2014;admit his sin or deny himself. As verse 22 tells us, &#x201c;But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.&#x201d; He decided he&#x2019;d rather hold onto the deception of self-righteousness, and have his money and posse...</p></p><h2>Wolf-Speaker (2) (The Immortals)</h2><p><b>Daine&#x2019;s magic must save her friends&#x2014;both wolf and human&#x2014;in this second book of the Immortals series, featuring an updated cover for longtime fans and fresh converts alike, and including an all-new afterword from Tamora Pierce.</b><br><br>When Daine is summoned to help a pack of wolves&#x2014;dear friends from her old village&#x2014;she and Numair travel to Dunlath Valley to answer the call.

Staring out of the Window</strong></p><p>We tend to reproach ourselves for staring out of the window. We are supposed to be working, or studying, or ticking off things on our to-do list. It can seem almost the definition of wasted time. It seems to produce nothing, to serve no purpose. We equate it with boredom, distraction, futility. The act of cupping our chin in our hands near a pane of glass and letting out eyes drift in the middle distance does not normally enjoy high prestige. We don't go around saying: 'I had a great day: the high point was staring out of the window.' But maybe in a better society that's just the sort of thing people would say to one another.</p><p>The point of staring out of a window is, paradoxically, not to find out what is going on outside. It is, rather, an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds. It's easy to imagine we know what we think, what we feel and what's going on in our heads. But we rarely do entirely. There's a huge amount of what makes us who we are that circulates unexplored and unused. Its potential lies untapped. It is shy and doesn't emerge under the pressure of direct questioning. If we do it right, staring out of the window offers a way for us to listen out for the quieter suggestions and perspectives of our deeper selves.</p><p>Plato suggested a metaphor for the mind: our ideas are like birds fluttering around in the aviary of our brains. But in order for the birds to settle, Plato understood that we needed periods of purpose-free calm. Staring out of the window offers such an opportunity. We see the world going on: a patch of weeds is holding its own against the wind; a grey tower block looms through the drizzle. But we don't need to respond; we have no overarching intentions, and so the more tentative parts of ourselves have a chance to be heard, like the sound of church bells in the city once the traffic has died down at night.</p><p>The potential of daydreaming isn't recognised by societies obsessed with productivity. But some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful and instead respect the creative potential of reverie. Window daydreaming is a little strategic rebellion against the excessive demands of immediate (but ultimately insignificant) pressures - in favour of the diffuse, but very serious, search for the wisdom of the unexplored deep self.</p><p>Some pleasures - like that of looking out of a window and wondering about life - are so quiet that we easily miss them. We don't quite detect them, even though they are really there - as one may fail to catch a whispered endearment in a noisy bar. But once properly alerted we can better direct our attention to something that turns out to be tender and lovely. Small pleasures are often of this kind. It is the task of culture to draw them to our notice, so that they can take up a larger, beneficial place in our lives.</p></p><h2>Cardboard Creations: Open-Ended Exploration with Recycled Materials</h2><p><p><strong>Look no further than your recycling bin to ignite your child's imagination!</strong> </p> <p>Featuring more than 20 sustainable art projects (with more than 75 different variations), <em>Cardboard Creations</em> shows you how to inspire creativity without having to buy fancy art supplies.<br><br>Whether you're a parent or caregiver in search of activities for just one child, or a seasoned art teacher looking for new projects to engage a group of children, this book is for you.

In this volume, author Karl Ricks Anderson brings to light unparalleled events and divine manifestations that were given during those early years of the Restoration. In Kirtland the Savior personally directed His Church and taught His Saints by appearing to at least twenty-three Church leaders or by speaking to them. Brother Anderson points out that more first-person words of the Lord have gone out to the world from Kirtland than from any other location in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was in Kirtland that Jesus Christ taught the world about His mission of the Atonement, the premortal and the postmortal worlds, and the structure of the Church. It was there He commanded that the first latter-day temple be built. And it was in the Kirtland Temple that the Lord began to restore sacred ordinances for the salvation of His children.

Finally, we get to touch Big Bird's feathers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> </b><br><br> <i>Sesame Street</i> is the longest-running-and arguably most beloved- children's television program ever created. Today, it reaches some six million preschoolers weekly in the United States and countless others in 140 countries around the world. <br><br> <i>Street Gang</i> is the compelling, comical, and inspiring story of a media masterpiece and pop-culture landmark. Television reporter and columnist Michael Davis-with the complete participation of Joan Ganz Cooney, one of the show's founders-unveils the idealistic personalities, decades of social and cultural change, stories of compassion and personal sacrifice, and miraculous efforts of writers, producers, directors, and puppeteers that together transformed an empty soundstage into the most recognizable block of real estate in television history.</p><p>Michael Davis was a Senior Editor and family TV Columnist for <i>TV Guide</i> from 1998-2007. A Neiman fellow, he has also worked for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> and <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>.<b>Prologue</b><p>Joan Ganz Coney walked toward the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, lost in a fog of grief. Ahead were the crenelated parapets that crown the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a Gothic Revival Glory on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Black limousines lined the curbside, clogging the street, as NYPD officers waved their arms in a futile effort to get vehicles moving. The sidewalks were overrun by pedestrians, hundreds of them, all moving toward the cathedral steps. Cooney walked alongside mothers with toddlers clutching Ernie dolls, students playing hooky from school, executives in crisp suits, Midtown secretaries in heels, Latinas in scoop-necked tops, and bohemian types sporting jeans, running shoes, and long ponytails. </p><p>It was May 21, 1990, five days after Jim Henson, her friend and creative partner since 1969, had died from a runaway strep infection gone stubbornly, foolishly untreated. There was no other word to describe his passing other than shocking, and it was played just that way in the papers and on the nightly news. People who didn't know him wept as if a favorite uncle had died, that subversive adult who sat with the adults at Thanksgiving but would have preferred dinner at the kids' table. They came out in force for the public memorial, filling the vast, vaulted sanctuary, even more than the organizers of the event had anticipated. Some five thousand attendees filled the pews, standing in the antechamber and spilling into the aisles. The overflow was so great that people had simply dropped their backpacks, folded up their strollers, and sat on the hard stone floor.</p><p>Clustered row upon row near them were mourners bound by their years together working for and with the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the nonprofit corporation Cooney helped build. Cooney took a seat next to Christopher Cerf, one of the founding fathers of "Sesame Street." </p><p>From the alter, the congregation was an impressionistic canvas, dappled with a profusion of spring green. That was to be expected. Just as teams, tribes, and nations have representative colors, Jim Henson owned Kermit green. </p><p>Cooney's thoughts wandered to Kermit and the early days of "Sesame Street." Reminders of that time were everywhere. Sitting nearby was Frank Oz, who in 1969&#x2014;Sesame's debut year&#x2014;became a Henson prot�g�, having joined the Muppets right out of high school. For more than twenty years, Oz had been uptight Bert to Henson's mischievous Ernie, the straight man of the odd-couple comedy duo. On "The Muppet Show," their roles had reversed; Oz was outrageously pushy Miss Piggy to Henson's pushed-on-the-brink Kermit.</p><p>At no time had Jim Henson's disparate worlds collided quite as markedly as at this memorial. Over to one side was Henson's friend Harry Belafonte. A humanitarian and artist, Belafonte had appeared on "The Muppet Show", where he introduced "Turn the World Around," a joyous, syncopated African folk melody that would be part of the day's program.</p><p>Not far away was Lorne Michaels, who gave the Muppets a weekly showcase during the audacious first season (1975) of "Saturday Night Live" at a time when the ambitious Henson feared he might be trapped for eternity in children's television. Henson's talent manager, Bernie Brillstein, saw to it that that never happened. Brillstein, who signed John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, and Gilda Radner, was like a second father to Henson, a Jewish one.</p><p>In the late 1980's, Henson had separated from his wife, Jane, the mother of his five children. For most of his career, he had been more married to his work than to Jane, and a relationship that began when they met as students at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland withered. Henson was known to work around the clock in the studio when a production deadline loomed, and his travel schedule and a list of business commitments would have seemed unreasonable to most. He seemed happier and more fulfilled away from home, but he craved time with his two sons and three daughters.</p><p>As a single man, Henson had his pick of staggeringly beautiful companions. Daryl Hannah, who had flown in from California for the service on a private jet and now wept softly in a pew, had been one of them. Henson went through a Hollywood stage in his late forties and early fifties, shedding his bohemian wardrobe for goods from Rodeo Drive. His beard was neatly trimmed and his hair styled for an appearance he'd made with Kermit on the late-night Arsenio Hall Show, just two days before he died. Complaining of a sore throat in the greenroom that day, he was uncharacteristically flat and slow on the uptake during the interview segment. Henson used the occasion to plug an upcoming special shot at Disney World in Orlando and to introduce Clifford, a new Muppet musician working with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the house band from The Muppet Show. African American puppeteer Kevin Clash gave voice and performance to Clifford, he of the fuchsia dreadlocks, sunglasses, and vocal delivery that was distinctly urban contemporary. Clash was sensational, bantering with the black comic as the audience howled.</p><p>Henson seemed to enjoy it as much as anyone, and he looked relieved to have Clash carry the load. It was Henson's final televised interview.</p><p>Chris Cerf lost a dear friend and comic collaborator in Henson. Walking into the memorial, he was numb with grief, but being surrounded by his CTW colleagues was a comfort. Only months earlier, "Sesame Street" composer-arranger extraordinaire Joe Raposo had been laid to rest, dead at age fifty-one from complications of lymphoma. </p><p>Cerf composed tunes for "Sesame Street" as well, half-silly, half-sophisticated parody numbers. As the son of Bennett Cerf, the witty cofounder of Random House, Chris had used his book-world DNA to create the first paperback library of "Sesame Street" books. He was also sly and unpredictable, which made him a perfect fit for Henson's extended family of mirth makers. Cerf provided many good times in Sesame's freewheeling formative days, when an elaborate prank would reduce Henson to a puddle.</p><p>Cooney knew that everything about "Sesame Street" had been unalterably turned upside town the minute Jim Henson was declared dead at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 16.</p><p>In his final hour, he twice went into cardiac arrest, as the raging infection shut down his organs and left him struggling for air, surrounded by strangers. The cause of his death was Group A streptococcal pneumonia, an infection that probably started with that sore throat he complained about in Los Angeles the night of the Arsenio taping. A timely course of penicillin would have saved him, but he chose not to seek medical help until it was too late. Henson, whose mother was a practicing Christian Scientist, had considered calling a faith healer, but, after hours of feverish decline, he finally acceded to be taken to the hospital. Around 4 a.m., Henson's publicist Arthur Novell received a phone call in San Francisco. "Oh Arthur, I'm not feeling well," Henson rasped. Sensing danger, Novell arranged for a Manhattan car service to pick up Henson at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel. Henson, whose organs were failing, walked to the lobby and got into the limo. Precious minutes were lost as the driver pulled up to a door at New York Hospital that was three-quarters of a block away from the emergency entrance. More time was lost when Henson sent the driver on his way, insisting he could walk to the ER. There was no arguing with him. For all his exceptional attributes, Henson was a willful, unyielding man who almost always got his way. This served him well in business, where he could wear people down.</p><p>Jim Henson was a genius, and not only for reinventing puppetry for the television age and for inspiring a raft of characters that make you smile just thinking about them. Henson was a genius businessman, as well. His only flaws might have been an inability to stay within budget for his feature-length films and his unwillingness to fire people when prudence would have suggested he should do so. He always found someone else to take that responsibility.</p><p>"Puppetry," he once said, "is a way of hiding." At six foot three and perpetually bearded to cover acne scars, Henson was defined by bemusing and often baffling contradictions. He was shy by nature, yet his creations were explosively silly and spontaneous. Often reticent and contemplative, at times he eagerly played the Pied Piper, organizing one of New York's most outrageous annual costume parties. He spoke of simple pleasures but had a taste for European casinos, costal vacation homes, and four-star dining. He lived large but, as a proto-environmentalist, talked of protecting a small planet's shrinking resources. He embraced and celebrated life exuberantly and spread acres of joy but suffered through at least one major depression after his fantasy film, <i>The Dark Crystal</i>, bombed at the box office and was dismissed by&nbsp;critics.</p><p>Henson was deeply unhappy and fatigued in the months leading up to his death. Many believed he sensed that he would not live to see grandchildren, pointing to a plan he had drawn up five years earlier for the public memorial service as evidence that he believed the end was near. It was included in letters left behind for each of his children, in which Henson indicated a burning curiosity about the afterlife and an eagerness to reconnect with the dead, and assured the children that he would be waiting for them "on the other side." He also asked his survivors to bring everyone together for a few songs and stories, insisting that guests avoid wearing funeral black. As a son of the South and a jazz fancier, he requested that a New Orleans-style band play "When the Saints Go Marching In." He requested that the proceedings be entertaining and light, hoping that friends and colleagues would provide laughter in large doses and silliness worthy of the Muppets. </p><p>Henson wrote the letter three years before he began working&#x2014;without a contract&#x2014;for The Walt Disney Company. Doing so, some believe, was the beginning of the end.</p><p>Disney CEO Michael D. Eisner waited for the proceedings to begin alongside Frank Wells, his No. 2 at the company. In the late 1980's, Eisner had been clever enough to see that Disney's cast of classic characters aimed at the very young, such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy, were being slowly supplanted in children's hearts by fresher, hipper icons. Eisner and Wells had pledged a huge pile of Disney dollars&#x2014;a sum estimated to be between $100 million and $150 million&#x2014;to purchase Henson's production company and library of film and television properties. The price included ownership of the boisterous, satirical, and sometime sardonic puppet ensemble that had made The Muppet Show a worldwide sensation, but it did not&#x2014;and would not&#x2014;include the Muppets Henson had specifically created for "Sesame Street." </p><p>Henson believed there was no entertainment company better suited than Disney to perpetuate such multidimensional characters as Miss Piggy, the porcine diva; Fozzie Bear, the clueless comic; and hectoring balcony critics Statler and Waldorf. Disney's litigious history of protecting its characters in the stuff of Hollywood legend. Under Eisner, the company once sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over an unauthorized Oscar appearance by an actress portraying Snow White. </p><p>Cooney knew Eisner to be cold, arrogant, and insistent when he was in pursuit of a creative property. She was not pleased with his predatory forays into "Sesame Street." Her gut churned as she considered how miserable Eisner had made things for Henson in his final months. Henson's gentle manner masked a steely shrewdness&#x2014;you could not budge him if he didn't want to be budged&#x2014;but Eisner had been surprisingly relentless in the Henson campaign. Cooney&#x2014;a courteous woman who had persuaded senators and top philanthropists to do her bidding, who had stared down cancer, and who was married to a private-equity mogul who could quite possibly arrange to buy the entire Disney company if push came to shove&#x2014;was not intimidated by his tactics. </p><p>Cooney held Disney in high regard but regarded the company's merchandising arms as competitors in the marketplace of character-licensed toys, games, and consumer goods. She was convinced that Eisner would not be satisfied until his deal with Henson was sweetened by ownership of the Sesame Muppets, which generated an estimated $15 million to $17 million annually in licensing and merchandising fees split between Sesame Workshop and Henson Associates, Inc. In 1969, Henson had waived his performance fee for "Sesame Street" in exchange for full ownership of his characters, agreeing later to split any revenue generated by them.</p><p>In time, both organizations depended on that revenue for survival. By 1990, CTW had long shed its dependence on government and philanthropic grants, gaining its financial independence by building and sustaining a formidable endowment. Henson Associates, notorious for going over budget on productions, stayed afloat thanks to the huge popularity of its characters and the public's hunger for Muppet-licensed bed linens, apparel, computer games, action figures, books, CDs, and other products.</p><p>By 1989, after building his company from a husband-and-wife operation out of the trunk of his car into one of the world's most recognized entertainment brands. Henson was eager to return to a simpler existence of creating and performing. Disney had offered a way to cash out, and a letter of intent, by which he would have sold his privately held company to the California-based entertainment and media colossus, was already signed.</p><p>But after months of legal process, during which Henson had commenced working for Disney without a consummated deal, lingering doubts began to plague him. As media analysts were hailing the merger-in-progress as "a business association made in entertainment heaven," discord bubbled just beneath the surface at Disney Studios in Florida and California. Henson's employees, accustomed to his benevolence, creative freedom, and camaraderie, were suffering from massive culture shock in their day-to-day dealings within Disney's rapacious negotiate-everything hierarchy. They referred to their new working environment as Mauschwitz. </p><p>Beyond that, Henson was beginning to chafe at provisions in the deal for his exclusive personal services and for the rights to any future characters he might create. These were not unreasonable demands from a company about to dump an armored carload of cash at his door. But regret clearly was setting in for a man who valued creative freedom and independence how Henson felt, and she believed the whole situation was causing him immense grief and contributing to his lack of physical resistance. Henson felt that he would be Disney's highly compensated but indentured servants for the rest of his life. </p><p>What the business-page pundits and entertainment insiders never quite sniffed out about the stalled marriage had its roots in Eisner's covetous yen for the Sesame Muppets. Despite Henson's refusals to discuss the matter, Eisner wouldn't let up. Cooney recalled how early in the winter of 1990, Henson had invited her to attend what he described as a peace luncheon with Eisner, at which he wanted to put the m...</p></p><h2>Everything You Need To Know About Colloidal Silver</h2><p><p><strong>Give Your Body a Fighting Chance With Colloidal Silver</strong></p> <p>Don't put up with colds, flu and other infections</p> <p>Use the cheap natural antibiotic Colloidal Silver.</p> <p>This New Zealand Book by Max Crarer will show you how...</p> <p>Learn about:</p> <ul> <li>The side effects such as turning blue like a smurf is not one of them!</li> <li>The recommended dosage for you and your children</li> <li>The proper way to make it and what to use</li> </ul> <p><em>"My wife has suffered the pains of hell for 15 years with Lupus.

On this journey you will transform: <br><br>~ Procrastination and a lack of motivation into passion and action.<br>~ Mental doubts into confidence and courage.<br>~ Overwhelm into mental clarity, and perspective.<br>~ Numbness and confusion into creativity that shines through a free and open heart. <br><br>As one reviewer wrote: <br><br>&#x201c;Aaran is beloved for sharing such deep and personal wisdom. In all my years of self-discovery, I've never come across someone who understands exactly what I've gone through the way Aaran does and how to master a part of myself in such simple steps, through contemplation and journaling. Not only do I think this is a well-planned tutorial, but it truly comes from a place of love.&#x201d; <br><br>Becoming a true mystic, you will learn that trying to distinguish between your thoughts and emotions and the thoughts and emotions of others is an endless, looping, and exhausting task and that there actually is no difference. You will go on a journey of emotional healing and understand why your unique empathic ability has awakened. You will embrace the profound messages you receive from your inner voice; finding the confidence to share those messages with the world. <br><br>em�path: a person who is awakening to the oneness of all beings and who has become aware of their ability to apprehend the mental and emotional states of others. <br><br>mys�tic: a person who has a spiritual apprehension of truths that are beyond the intellect and who allows those truths to guide their life. <br><br>The world&#x2019;s most well known modern mystics, from The Dalai Lama and Deepak Chopra to Pema Chodron and Eckart Tolle emphasize the importance of practice when seeking connection with your authentic self. Therefore, while providing you with a detailed intellectual comprehension of your empathic and spiritual ability, Empath to Mystic also offers a practical guide to using it. It contains over 220 meditations, journaling prompts, and action steps that will help transform your life from the inside out. <br><br>Becoming a master of your inner voice and intuition is about so much more than getting clear answers to life&#x2019;s questions or having a finely tuned instrument for manifestation. It is ultimately about awakening to the truth of yourself and knowing without question what your work is in the world. It is about self-love and absolute confidence in your intuition. It is about opening your heart and turning your intuition into a powerful tool that helps others. <br><br>Aaran and his book Empath to Mystic will illuminate the path to fearlessly being yourself and to living an abundant life that is a testimony of passion, freedom, and confidently &#x2018;dancing to the beat of your own drum.&#x2019; <br><br>Will you step up to reclaim your authentic vision, inner connection, silent receptivity, and purposeful creation? <br><br></p><p><p>I enjoyed the format of the text. Being able to ponder the concepts and then be able to apply it to my own circumstances really drove the messages home. I read this book to try and figure out what I was missing in my healing journey; this book definitely helped me gain some insight into some deep pockets of my mentality! If you are looking to dig a bit deeper into yourself, I highly recommend Aaran's book!!</p><p> </p><p>I'm so happy to have found this book! I found Aaran's approach to re-discovering intuition to be so practical and thoughtfully laid out that I was able to get past my old story about being too sensitive and find gratitude for my gifts. I just started going through the book a second time to connect more deeply with the journal prompts and visualizations. I can't wait to share this book with family and friends. Highly recommended!</p><p> </p><p>All of us, at one time or another, (perhaps only as infants), have been truly connected to our inner voice, intuition, had boundaries, and strengths. If you have lost these, or feel like you never really had them, this book does not waste time getting you back there through captivating discussion, visualizations, journaling prompts and more. Aaran has put a lifetime of experience as a mystic into this book.<br> I am excited about the discoveries I have made and the changes that this book has brought to my life.</p><p> </p><p>This book is like having a down-to-earth friend and a spiritual guide with you on the journey at the same time. Practical, insightful and empowering. The journal prompts brought me great insight and inevitably came along at times I needed them. The book is amazing, and the inspired transformation is a work in progress!</p><p> </p><p>I was truly inspired by this book. It is a great guide to finding your inner self and using that knowledge to live your life to the fullest. I found the sections with questions and suggestions for taking action to be very helpful. I definitely recommend it.</p><p> </p><p>Aaran was a student of mine many years ago at Omega Institute, and I am very impressed by his new book. The diligence of his work on being an empath goes far beyond what I have seen in other books, including some very well known authors. Empath To Mystic offers practical and down to earth solutions for dealing with those issues many empaths have, and offers a path of empowerment to take the reigns of those spiritual gifts rather than be ruled by them, to squeeze the juice from those gifts and turn them into a mystical elixir!</p><p> </p><p>This book is by an inspirational writer, it is full of information and challenges. Not a quick read, as there are plenty of 'exercises' to help the reader develop his/her spirituality, but easily worth the investment of time.</p><p> </p><p>I have been following Aaran's work for a while. I have found his teachings to be very poignant, addressing the core of difficulties and spot on for each person who reads it. He outlines the 4 different types of difficulties that people might have towards connecting with their true self and becoming a mystic in this book. I have found it very helpful and insightful. I recommend everyone to read it!</p></p><h2>Urusei Yatsura, Vol. 2 (2)</h2><p>The hilarious manga classic featuring beautiful space alien princess Lum!<br><br>Beautiful space alien princess Lum invades Earth on her UFO, and unlucky Ataru Moroboshi&#x2019;s world gets turned upside down!

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, <i>Urusei Yatsura</i>, was serialized in <i>Weekly Shonen Sunday.</i> This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another&#x2014;<i>Maison Ikkoku</i> ran from 1980 to 1987, <i>Ranma 1/2</i> from 1987 to 1996, and <i>Inuyasha</i> from 1996 to 2008.

Distinguished by her wonderfully endearing characters, Takahashi&#x2019;s work adeptly incorporates a wide variety of elements such as comedy, romance, fantasy, and martial arts. While her series are difficult to pin down into one simple genre, the signature style she has created has come to be known as the &#x201c;Rumic World.&#x201d; Rumiko Takahashi is an artist who truly represents the very best from the world of manga.</p><h2>Mouse Guard Roleplaying Game Box Set, 2nd Ed.</h2><p>Finally back in print, this second edition of the <i>Mouse Guard Roleplaying Game Box Set </i>contains everything players need to know about the world of the Guard, including rules for forming patrols and leading missions into the beleaguered territories.<br> <br>This second edition of the Origins Award-winning game contains new art, additional Action, Weapon, and Condition cards, and a revised and updated rule book.</p><p>David Petersen was born in 1977.

Readers might be lost in a new world if they start with this adaptation, but those familiar with the first installment will be immersed in a dark and exciting adventure. For newcomers, this format can serve as a gateway into Riggs's original books, while for existing fans, they are an opportunity to experience the stories and characters in a different way. Jean's loose yet detailed and evocative illustrations serve the narrative well, with echoes of traditional manga and a minimalist palette seen in of some of today's darker comics. The found photographs that were such an important factor of the original novels are featured throughout, providing an air of authenticity and mystery.

Henry likes things organized. When he realizes that the farm outside his sty is a mess, he worries that no one will be able to find anything. His solution is to draw a map. Going from the sheep's woolshed to the cow pasture to the stable and the chicken coop, Henry shows his growing creation to the animals along the way. The animals are excited to see sketches of themselves and soon join the cartography expedition, ending on the hill above the farm. The parade, with chickens and sheep taking a ride on horses and Henry's little trotters leading the way, sets the tone for comedy. When the livestock reach the top of the hill to compare the map to the actual farm, they are horrified to see that, while the map (and the hill) is filled with animals, the farm is empty! Racing back, the group checks each place and finds that now-miraculously-the animals are back in their places. Phew! Henry's face, often filled with a worried scowl, allows readers to feel his need for order. Detailed pencil-and-watercolor illustrations add to the comedic timing, especially when Henry finds his face in the mirror, in the sty, right where he belongs. Here's hoping for many more Henry-centric adventures."--<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i><br><br><b>Praise for <i>Henry&#x2019;s Map</i>:</b><br>&nbsp;<br>*** &#x201c;With appealing characters and gentle humor, this book will be a hit at storytime, or as an introduction to mapping lessons.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i> *** (starred)<br>&nbsp;<br>*** &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s hoping for many more Henry-centric adventures.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews ***</i>&nbsp; (starred)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Elliot&#x2019;s barnyard animals brim with personality and emotion, matching the understated humor of this charming story.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This story may even inspire budding cartographers to map their own world.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>The Life of John Wesley Hardin</h2><p>In an era and an area notable for badmen and gunslingers, John Wesley Hardin was perhaps the most notorious.

But Catholic theologian and conflict mediator Ann M. Garrido identifies conflict as a fruitful exchange that arises from living and working together in the diverse world God created. Garrido, author of the bestselling Redeeming Administration, offers twelve practical habits for responding to conflict. In Redeeming Conflict, Ann Garrido explains that conversion comes through conversation, that there is a difference between &#34;the truth&#34; and &#34;my truth,&#34; and that you should be curious and practice &#34;Pentecost listening&#34;-or empathetic listening-even if you think something is way off base. Garrido will help Christian leaders discover how to speak directly with colleagues about tensions and about how to get to know themselves well enough to keep from becoming defensive in the face of negative feedback. She uses saintly examples to illustrate her points, calling upon stories of St. Francis and a Muslim sultan, Leo the Great, Archbishop Oscar</p><p>Ann M. Garrido is associate professor of homiletics at Aquinas Institute of Theology in St. Louis, Missouri. While her first passion is teaching, for more than fifteen years she has found herself increasingly drawn to administrative roles. Garrido has served as senior editor of <i>Human Development Magazine</i> and is the author of five books, including the award-winning <i>Redeeming Administration</i>, which has sold more than 10,000 copies. She travels nationally and internationally doing conflict education and mediation work in both the business and Church worlds."Ann Garrido's <i>Redeeming Conflict</i> is a must for anyone engaged in pastoral ministry! It is an easy-to-read guide for understanding and even appreciating conflict as a practical way to move forward in relationships between persons and groups. The stories of saints and greats, known and unknown, are particularly interesting and insightful. Garrido's style is breezy and light, informed and rigorous. This book has the potential to make a great difference in how we, as persons and church, communicate, dialogue, and resolve problems." --<b>Sr. Rose Pacatte, F.S.P.</b>, Director of the Pauline Center for Media Studies<br><br>"Ann Garrido's book <i>Redeeming Administration</i> was a hit with the principals in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and taught us all that the 'ministry is in the interruption.' Now, with <i>Redeeming Conflict</i>, she teaches us that conflict is the mechanism whereby God 'matures creation.' While conflict is inevitable in both our work and personal lives, Garrido paints a wonderful picture of how we can effectively listen, navigate tensions, and live in communion with fellow travelers on this journey in faith." --<b>Kevin Baxter</b>, Senior Director and Superintendent of Schools, Archdiocese of Los Angeles<br><br>"Ann Garrido shares great insight into leading God's people and facing conflict. She helps us become more self-aware and fosters pastoral sensitivity for those unavoidable times when we encounter discord and tension." --<b>Most Rev. Gregory M. Aymond</b>, Archbishop of New Orleans<br><br>"We are once again indebted to Ann Garrido for leading us through an enlightening theological reflection on our common human experience and for helping us see the task of redeeming conflict as a lifelong calling to enter more deeply into the very heart of God." --<b>David Lichter</b>, Executive Director, National Association of Catholic Chaplains<br><br>"Every person in a leadership position--indeed anyone who is employed--should first be <i>required</i> to review this book. Dr. Garrido takes us on a journey of self-reflection through her questions at the end, and throughout each chapter which, if we are honest with ourselves, has the ability to transform the world's thinking." --<b>Janice Edwards-Armstrong</b>, Director of Leadership Education, Association of Theological Schools</p><h2>Crow Call</h2><p>Two-time Newbery medalist Lois Lowry has crafted a beautiful picture book about the power of longing and the importance of reconnection between a girl and her father in post-WWII America.<br><br>This is the story of young Liz, her father, and their strained relationship. Dad has been away at WWII for longer than she can remember, and they begin their journey of reconnection through a hunting shirt, cherry pie, tender conversation, and the crow call. This allegorical story shows how, like the birds gathering above, the relationship between the girl and her father is graced with the chance to fly.</p><p>Lois Lowry is the author of many acclaimed books for children. She is a two-time Newbery Award winner -- for NUMBER THE STARS, a book that is required reading in many classrooms, and THE GIVER, which remains one of the most talked-about and debated books in children's publishing history.

Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2014;Based on the reminiscence of a day in 1945, Lowry's nostalgic story has appeal that will resonate with 21st-century children. Lizzie's father has just returned from serving in World War II and she's a bit shy even though she's excited about spending the day with him. They are going to hunt crows that are eating the farmers' crops. The eight-year-old is warmly dressed in a man's plaid wool shirt that she had admired in a store window and her father bought for her even though it comes down to her knees. After an early diner breakfast of her favorite cherry pie, they head toward the woods. Being in charge of the crow call, a whistle intended to lure prey to the hunter, Lizzie is impressed with the number of birds she entices, yet feels uncomfortable because they are about to be killed. However, her father never raises his rifle; he simply enjoys watching his enthralled daughter and the multitude of birds that have heeded her call. Remarkable, atmospheric illustrations reveal the subdued, cool autumn colors of crunchy dried grass, softly hued sky, and dark leafless trees. The memory of a treasured day spent with a special person will resonate with readers everywhere.&#x2014;<i>Maryann H.

HURRY UP AND let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; I called to Bess and George as I popped open the trunk of my car. I had parked in front of George&#x2019;s house and was in a rush to get going.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave it to you to be right on time, Nancy,&#x201d; Bess teased as she and George walked down the front steps of the porch and headed toward me, overnight bags in hand. George glanced at her watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa, Bess is right!&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nine a.m. on the dot.&#x201d; She grabbed Bess&#x2019;s bag and tossed it and her own into the trunk before slamming it shut.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s when I told you I&#x2019;d be here,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m really looking forward to getting to the lake early so we can settle into our cabin and go for a hike before it gets too hot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ugh,&#x201d; Bess groaned. &#x201c;Not a hike! You and George promised me this would be a relaxing weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And it will be,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A short hike this morning, followed by a canoe ride this afternoon. Then tomorrow we can sleep in and read and relax before we go waterskiing after lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess rolled her eyes at me. I could tell she would have preferred spending the entire weekend doing nothing but sitting on the shores of Moon Lake with a magazine and a bottle of nail polish to touch up her manicure and pedicure. But there&#x2019;s no way I could manage that&#x2014;I would get way too antsy.<br> <br>Besides the outdoor activities, I also planned to read the latest Miles Whitmore mystery, Terror on the Trail. Lately, I couldn&#x2019;t get enough of his books. I never figured out &#x201c;whodunit&#x201d; till the very end, and I&#x2019;m an amateur detective. That&#x2019;s how crafty a writer he is.<br> <br>I pulled away from George&#x2019;s house and maneuvered my car toward the highway. Once we got going, it was only about fifty miles to Avondale, which is where Moon Lake is located. If we didn&#x2019;t hit any traffic, we&#x2019;d be there in under an hour.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make it up to you, Bess,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;You have complete control over music for the entire weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Bess asked, incredulous. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I believe you. You always hate any group I like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really. I promise,&#x201d; George said. I was impressed. George can be incredibly opinionated when it comes to music. She and Bess are my best friends, and they also happen to be cousins. But the two are as different as Beethoven and The Rolling Stones. Sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to believe they&#x2019;re related.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I suppose that&#x2019;s something,&#x201d; Bess said with a sigh. She plugged her MP3 into the radio and out blasted Grayson &amp; James, her latest favorite group.<br> <br>I saw George in the rearview mirror, and I knew she was working hard to restrain herself. I saw her putting on her own headphones to drown out Bess&#x2019;s music.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; Bess half apologized, sensing George&#x2019;s frustration. &#x201c;But this is great driving music, isn&#x2019;t it, Nancy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I actually like this song,&#x201d; I admitted sheepishly. I was trying to keep the peace between my friends, but I was also being truthful&#x2014;the song was catchy and fun. And with that, we all settled in to enjoy the ride.<br> <br><br><br>We pulled up to our rental cabin on Moon Lake almost exactly an hour later. Towering green pines surrounded the cabin, and the setting looked inviting. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get started&#x2014;within minutes, the car was unpacked and our hiking boots were on.<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise it will be a short hike, Bess,&#x201d; I told her as I pulled my hair into a tight ponytail. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just do one loop around the lake. We&#x2019;ll be back in time for lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Bess grumbled. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get this over with.&#x201d; She tightened the laces on her boots and the three of us headed for the trailhead, which happened to be just a few paces from our cabin.<br> <br>As we hiked, I took in the beautiful scenery and tried to let my mind wander. That can be tough for me, as I always have some mystery on my mind&#x2014;a real one or one in a book.<br> <br>But this weekend at the lake I really planned to focus on my friends and the great outdoors.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, Nancy?&#x201d; I heard George say. She was looking at me as though she&#x2019;d been talking to me for five minutes without a response. Which, come to think of it, was quite possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, uh, sorry, George,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I guess I was lost in my own world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I said, that&#x2019;s our cabin right there, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; George repeated, pointing to the little wooden structure peeking through the trees a few hundred yards ahead of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; I replied, glancing at my watch. &#x201c;Wow, that was quick.&#x201d; It had taken us less than an hour to hike the three-mile loop around the lake. Even Bess agreed that it had been pleasant and not particularly taxing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great!&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m ready for Hannah&#x2019;s lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Back at the cabin, I went into the kitchen to get the basket Hannah had packed for our weekend. Hannah Gruen is my dad&#x2019;s housekeeper, and she loves to keep all of us well fed and nurtured&#x2014;she&#x2019;s got lots of love to share. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to dig into some of her famous fried chicken and homemade coleslaw.<br> <br>But the basket was nowhere to be found. Suddenly an image of it popped into my head. It was sitting on the counter&#x2014;the counter at my house in River Heights, that is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bad news,&#x201d; I groaned. &#x201c;I left the lunch basket Hannah packed for us at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you were rushing like crazy to get up here,&#x201d; George said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s my stomach supposed to do?&#x201d; she joked.<br> <br>Bess smiled broadly. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ll just have to make a trip into town, then,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not far away, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure Avondale has a bunch of caf�s and cute stores.&#x201d;<br> <br>She emphasized the word &#x201c;stores,&#x201d; and knowing Bess, she was eager to squeeze in some shopping along with lunch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;Because I also left Terror on the Trail at home, so now I have nothing to read. Hopefully there&#x2019;s a bookstore in town too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Terror on the what?&#x201d; George asked. &#x201c;Do you ever stop trying to solve mysteries?&#x201d; She tapped her tablet, which was perched on a nightstand. &#x201c;You know, Nancy,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;you wouldn&#x2019;t have this problem if you weren&#x2019;t so resistant to e-books. You could take ten books with you at once.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As long as she remembered to actually bring the reader,&#x201d; Bess pointed out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha, ha,&#x201d; I said drily. &#x201c;But you know what? When it comes to books, I like the feel of the pages in my hands, and even the smell of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Nancy,&#x201d; George teased. &#x201c;Always with her nose in a book&#x2014;literally. Now let&#x2019;s go&#x2014;I&#x2019;m starving!&#x201d;<br> <br><br><br>Ten minutes later we pulled into the town of Avondale. And Bess was right&#x2014;there were plenty of quaint stores and shops. But that&#x2019;s not what caught my attention. Two fire trucks were stopped in the middle of the street, and an acrid smell filled the air.<br> <br>We parked and quickly made our way toward the crowd that had formed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Was there a fire?&#x201d; I asked a man with a golden retriever close by his side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks that way,&#x201d; he replied, shaking his head and gesturing toward a nearby building. A sign in front of the shop was in the shape of an open book. &#x201c;And at Paige&#x2019;s Pages, of all places.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nearby, three young women had their heads together, whispering&#x2014;but loud enough that we could hear them.<br> <br>&#x201c;And now we won&#x2019;t get to meet Lacey O&#x2019;Brien,&#x201d; one of them said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it, Carly!&#x201d; another replied. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve read all her mysteries.&#x201d;<br> <br>That word got my attention. I moved closer to the girls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do you know what happened? We&#x2019;re just here for the weekend, but what&#x2019;s going on here? I was trying to get to the bookstore, but it looks like that&#x2019;s going to be, uh, difficult.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were here for the bookstore too,&#x201d; the first girl replied. &#x201c;Lacey O&#x2019;Brien was supposed to do a reading and a book signing&#x2014;you know, the mystery writer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard of her, sure,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s like a local celebrity around here,&#x201d; the second girl, who had dark, curly hair, said. &#x201c;Well, except that people hardly ever see her. I heard this book signing was the only one she was doing all year.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And now we&#x2019;re out of luck, aren&#x2019;t we, Mandy?&#x201d; the third girl added. &#x201c;No signing today.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girls continued chattering, and I took a few steps back. But I could still hear them clearly. In fact, everyone around us could. A firefighter near us was talking with a distraught-looking woman with graying hair who was pointing to the store.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you realize there was a fire in her latest book, Burned?&#x201d; Mandy whisper-shouted to her friends.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right!&#x201d; Carly answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a weird coincidence. You don&#x2019;t think Lacey had anything to do with this fire, do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, at least something finally happened here. Nothing exciting or mysterious ever happens in Avondale,&#x201d; Mandy said.<br> <br>I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure, I thought. That&#x2019;s what everyone thinks until something actually happens.<br> <br>At that moment, one of the other firefighters approached us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone, please step back,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;We need to get our equipment out of the store.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, no problem,&#x201d; George said. We all moved back, but Mandy had ideas of her own and went right up to the fireman.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;We really, really wanted to see Lacey O&#x2019;Brien today. And now we might have to wait another year until we do.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could have sworn the fireman rolled his eyes. But he patiently answered her question. &#x201c;From our initial investigation, it looks like some faulty wiring in an old chandelier,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;That happens a lot in older buildings like this one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mandy gasped. &#x201c;It does?&#x201d; she asked, an amazed look on her face. &#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s exactly how the fire started in Lacey O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s last book! Except the wiring in the chandelier hadn&#x2019;t really caused the fire. It was arson!&#x201d;</p><h2>The Power of Now: 50 Inspiration Cards</h2><p>For admirers of <i>The Power of Now</i>, Eckhart Tolle&#x2019;s wisdom now comes in a highly accessible form an elegant boxed set of color cards.

She lives in Santa Barbara, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b> Celia&#x2019;s Daughter</b><br> &nbsp;<br> June 27, 1950, should have been a day of triumph for an ambitious young girl just turned seventeen&#x2014;the culmination of four years of outstanding academic achievement. It was graduation day at Brook�lyn&#x2019;s James Madison High School. Ruth Bader had been chosen as just one of four students to speak for her eight hundred classmates. Instead, it was a day of wrenching grief.<br><br> Two days before, Ruth&#x2019;s mother, Celia, had succumbed to cancer after a four-year struggle. Ruth knew her mother had been waging a los�ing battle. Watching the physical deterioration of the parent who repre�sented nurture and security, along with her father&#x2019;s silent grief, had been anguishing for the sensitive adolescent. Yet with Celia&#x2019;s encouragement, she won prestigious college scholarships, played in the school orchestra, and cheered on the football team as a baton twirler&#x2014;never once reveal�ing to her schoolmates the illness that shadowed the Bader household in Flatbush. By the end of summer, the ground floor of the modest gray stucco house at 1584 East Ninth Street stood vacant, a symbol of loss and abandonment following her mother&#x2019;s death and her father&#x2019;s emotional and economic collapse.<br><br> ***<br><br> Celia Bader gave birth to her second daughter, Joan Ruth, on March 15, 1933, at Beth Moses Hospital in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. (Ruth&#x2019;s first name was dropped in kindergarten when there proved to be too many other children who answered to Joan.) The Baders brought the infant back to their apartment in Belle Harbor, a town near the ocean in the borough of Queens, just as they had her older sister, Marilyn. The new baby, energetic from the start, kicked so much that Marilyn promptly dubbed her &#x201c;Kiki.&#x201d; The name stuck.<br><br> The boroughs, like the rest of the country in 1933, faced an unprec�edented economic depression. Factories lay idle. Construction had come to a standstill. The banking system had crumbled, wiping out the hard-earned savings of millions. One wage earner in four was laid off, and according to the U.S. Children&#x2019;s Bureau one out of five children was not getting enough to eat. As tax revenues dried up, teachers went unpaid. In other parts of the country, schools simply closed their doors. In the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, jobless men put up makeshift shacks of junked Fords and old barrels at the city dump dubbed &#x201c;Hoovervilles&#x201d; in derisive reference to President Herbert Hoover&#x2019;s economic policies.<br><br> Nathan Bader, Ruth&#x2019;s father, was no stranger to hard times. He had begun his own struggle to earn a living shortly after his arrival in New York as a shy thirteen-year-old Russian Jew from a town near Odessa. Denied admission to schools in the Old World because of anti-Semitism, he had attended only Hebrew school. His mother tongue was Yiddish until he learned English at night school in his new homeland. Nathan worked in his father&#x2019;s business, Samuel Bader and Sons, which special�ized in inexpensive furs. By the 1920s, he felt financially secure enough to marry Celia Amster.<br><br> Celia, who arrived in New York City while still in her mother&#x2019;s womb, had been conceived in a little town near what is now Cracow, Poland. Growing up in a Yiddish-speaking household in Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East Side, the primal homeland for immigrant Jews, she developed a passion for reading. Indeed, she so often walked down the bustling, crowded streets with her head buried in a book that on one occasion she tripped and broke her nose. Her father, recognizing that she was the most intel�ligent of his three daughters, had enlisted her help with his bills, which she wrote out in a mixture of English and Yiddish: for example, &#x201c;one cabinet, gefixed&#x201d; (repaired).<br><br> Though eager to continue her education, Celia had to settle for a commercial emphasis in her course work at Julia Richman High School, a massive brick building on East Sixty-Seventh Street. At least the train�ing would spare her the fate of her older sister, Sadie, who worked in a sweatshop until marriage. Upon graduating at the age of fifteen, Celia found a job as a bookkeeper and secretary for a fur maker in the bustling, densely packed garment district, a roughly rectangular area of Manhat�tan ringed by West Thirty-Fifth and Forty-Second Streets and Seventh and Ninth Avenues, where a largely Eastern European workforce fueled the trade. The position allowed her to develop a familiarity with the industry, capitalizing on her innate business instincts and her ability to shrewdly assess people.<br><br> The personable and highly intelligent young woman had just the qualities that the shy, sentimental Nathan instinctively sought in a wife. Celia, according to her daughter, would always be the stronger partner in their new household, advising her husband on his business as well as other matters. After marriage, the couple joined the Belle Harbor syna�gogue. In 1927, two years before the stock market crash, Celia gave birth to their first child, Marilyn Elsa.<br><br> ***<br><br> The downward economic spiral after Black Thursday in October 1929 prompted many young couples like the Baders to delay having more children. But in the fall of 1932, a new baby was on the way. Three years later, economic recovery remained elusive. Despite the Roosevelt administration&#x2019;s many initiatives, the country remained mired in pov�erty and despair. The Baders were spared the worst hardships; however, in 1934, they faced a different kind of loss. Six-year-old Marilyn was fatally stricken with spinal meningitis. Though Kiki was too young to remember her sister, she later recalled how deeply her parents mourned Marilyn&#x2019;s death. Every month, in the cold of winter or the heat of sum�mer, they trudged to the cemetery. On the anniversary of Marilyn&#x2019;s death, they went to the synagogue to recite the Kaddish, the traditional Jewish prayer of mourning. Marilyn&#x2019;s picture continued to hang over the headboard of the Baders&#x2019; bed, making her a looming presence through�out Kiki&#x2019;s childhood. There is no way to measure the impact of parental grief on their surviving daughter or to know whether it contributed to her preternatural seriousness. Ruth herself, however, later remarked that she grew up with the very &#x201c;smell of death,&#x201d; alluding to the cloud her sister&#x2019;s passing cast over the Bader household.<br><br> Hoping to ease the pain with new surroundings, Nathan and Celia moved to Brooklyn, though the neighborhood was less desirable than the one left behind in Belle Harbor. They soon discovered that sustain�ing a separate apartment even in Flatbush was economically impossible. Because Nathan&#x2019;s brother Benjamin had married Celia&#x2019;s younger sister, Bernice (Buddy), the Bader brothers and their wives decided to share the downstairs of a two-family house in Flatbush until they could afford to live in separate houses on East Ninth Street.<br><br> Though the move to Flatbush was primarily initiated as a response to grief, it eventually turned out to be fortuitous. Flatbush was one of Brooklyn&#x2019;s six original colonial towns. Over the years, it had been trans�formed into a semi-urban area with a Jewish population that by 1930 was rapidly approaching the million mark, the largest concentration of urban Jews in the world. Yet the Jewish community was anything but homogeneous. Groups differed in culture, wealth, and religious affili�ation as well as in origin&#x2014;Western European, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern. Brooklyn&#x2019;s Syrian Sephardic Jews&#x2014;a minority within a minority&#x2014;maintained their traditional ways and food preferences as well as their Arabic language. In contrast, the many Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews tried hard to assimilate. After achieving some modest economic success, most moved out from the Lower East Side and from more crowded Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Browns�ville to escape the congestion and shabbiness along with the weight of old-world strictures. If not quite the suburbs, the move brought more grass and open space.<br><br> As a sign of their newfound freedom, Jews of Nathan and Celia&#x2019;s generation often strayed from Orthodox Judaism with all its rules and rituals. Many chose to forgo Sabbath services, leaving Brooklyn&#x2019;s houses of worship half-empty on Saturday mornings. Sloughing off vestiges of their cultural and ethnic distinctiveness, they took pride in their &#x201c;Americanness&#x201d;&#x2014;their ability to speak English, to wear American clothes, to have an education beyond the Talmud, and to escape the historical cycle that had locked even the most ambitious sons into the ghetto.<br><br> Yet at the same time, even those who were secular clung to cherished parts of their tradition&#x2014;lighting candles for Friday dinner, keeping kosher kitchens while their children were young or eating only kosher meat and poultry, and observing the more important religious holidays, notably the high holy days from Rosh Hashanah through Yom Kip�pur. Those needing a synagogue for the holy days had plenty of choices; more than half of all the synagogues in New York City had a Brooklyn address. Some in the community relished the sense of belonging that came from hearing a Yiddish radio station playing popular dramas such as <i>Bei tate-mames tish </i>(Round the family table) or musical programs like <i>Yiddish Melodies in Swing</i>&#x2014;though not Celia, who saw Yiddish as the language of the Old World. Instead, the Bader family listened to <i>The Goldbergs, </i>a weekly comedy-drama created by the talented writer and actress Gertrude Berg. Playing the warmhearted Bronx matriarch Molly Goldberg, Berg guided her radio family and neighbors through the challenges of assimilating and simultaneously maintaining their roots as Jews while coping with the travails of the Great Depression and World War II. Mrs. Goldberg was an &#x201c;amalgam of Jewish aunts, [mothers], and grandmothers,&#x201d; Kiki later recalled. However, she hastened to point out that her own mother &#x201c;did not yell out of the window&#x201d; in their working-class neighborhood, as did Molly Goldberg. <br><br> Flatbush in the 1930s and 1940s was home not only to Jews but also to Italians, Irish, and a smattering of Poles who lived on the same tree-lined streets, abutting busy Coney Island Avenue and Kings Highway. Each ethnic group was secure in its own identity, but that did not negate tensions among them. Anti-Semitism in the immediate neighborhood of East Ninth Street was not a major problem, although it certainly existed. Two elderly Catholic women living on the same block as the Baders clung to the belief that if a Jew came into the house, especially for lunch, it would bring bad luck&#x2014;a superstition they transmitted to the boys for whom they served as foster parents. Other children on the street repeated stories that matzo was made from the blood of Christian boys and called Kiki and her Jewish friends &#x201c;kikes.&#x201d; Nonetheless, a measure of tolerance prevailed in the neighborhood of modest homes and apartments.<br><br> Both homes and streets served as children&#x2019;s playgrounds for games of &#x201c;red light, green light,&#x201d; giant steps, jump rope, jacks, and marbles. Before and after games, youngsters and especially their teenage siblings, gathered in nearby candy stores and soda shops to spend their twenty-five-cent weekly allowances on Cokes, egg creams, comic books, movie magazines, and an occasional newspaper.<br><br> What bound the citizens of Flatbush together was a sense of neigh�borhood solidarity and an intense yearning to be solidly middle class. Even if the Great Depression had thwarted their own youthful dreams, they could transfer hopes and aspirations to their children. Weathering the strains of the worst economic crisis the country had ever experienced, they nurtured a disproportionate share of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most distinguished citizens&#x2014;many of them Jews. George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, Alfred Kazin, Norman Mailer, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Beverly Sills, Barbra Streisand, Milton Friedman, and Sandy Koufax would become household names. So would that of Nathan and Celia Bader&#x2019;s daughter.</p><h2>How to Multiply Your Baby&#39;s Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution Series)</h2><p><p>Time and again, the work performed at The Institutes for&nbsp;the Achievement of Human Potential has demonstrated that children from birth to age six are capable of learning better and faster than older children. <i>How To Teach Your Baby To Read </i>shows just how easy it is to teach a young child to read, while <i>How To Teach Your Baby Math </i>presents the simple steps for teaching mathematics through the development of thinking and reasoning skills.

For years, large chemical companies had been using Toms River as their private dumping ground, burying tens of thousands of leaky drums in open pits and discharging billions of gallons of acid-laced wastewater into the town&#x2019;s namesake river. The result was a notorious cluster of childhood cancers scientifically linked to local air and water pollution.<br><br> Fagin recounts the sixty-year saga of rampant pollution and inadequate oversight that made Toms River a cautionary tale. He brings to life the pioneering scientists and physicians who first identified pollutants as a cause of cancer and the everyday people in Toms River who struggled for justice: a young boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast-growing tumors that had decimated his body from birth; a nurse who fought to bring the alarming incidence of childhood cancers to the attention of authorities who didn&#x2019;t want to listen; and a mother whose love for her stricken child transformed her into a tenacious advocate for change.<br><br> Rooted in a centuries-old scientific quest, <i>Toms River</i> is an epic of dumpers at midnight and deceptions in broad daylight, of corporate avarice and government neglect, and of a few brave individuals who refused to keep silent until the truth was exposed.</p><p>Newly available in paperback, Dan Fagin&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning tale of a small town ravaged by industrial pollution is environmental reporting at its best.Dan Fagin is an associate professor of journalism and the director of the Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting Program at New York University&#x2019;s Arthur L.

Even though she lives in Greenwich Village with a single mom who is a semifamous painter, Mia still puts on her Doc Martens one at a time, and the most exciting things she ever dreams about are smacking lips with sexy senior Josh Richter, "six feet of unadulterated hotness," and passing Algebra I. Then Mia's dad comes to town, and drops a major bomb. Turns out he's not just a European politician as he's always lead her to believe, but actually the prince of a small country! And Mia, his only heir, is now considered the crown princess of Genovia! She doesn't even know how to begin to cope: "I am so NOT a princess.... You never saw anyone who looked less like a princess than I do. I mean, I have really bad hair... and... a really big mouth and no breasts and feet that look like skis." And if this news wasn't bad enough, Mia's mom has started dating her algebra teacher, the paparazzi is showing up at school, and she's in a huge fight with her best friend, Lilly. How much more can this reluctant Cinderella handle?<p> Offbeat Mia will automatically win the heart of every teenage girl who's ever just wanted to fit in with as little fuss as possible.

Instead of grabbing a quick snack on your way out the door or eating just to calm down at the end of a stressful day, isn&#x2019;t it about time you let yourself truly appreciate a satisfying, nourishing meal?</p> <p>In our modern society, weight concerns, obesity rates, and obsession with appearance have changed the way we look at food&#x2014;and not necessarily for the better. If you have ever snacked when you weren&#x2019;t hungry, have used guilt as a guide for your eating habits, or have cut calories even when you felt hungry, you have experienced &#x201c;mindless&#x201d; eating firsthand. This mindless approach to food is dangerous, and can have serious health and emotional consequences. But if you&#x2019;ve been mindlessly eating all your life, it can be difficult to make a change. When it comes down to it, you must take a whole new approach to eating&#x2014;but where do you begin? Practicing mindful eating habits may be just the thing to make that important change. In fact, it might just be the answer you&#x2019;ve been searching for all these years.</p> <p>The breakthrough approaches in <em>Eating Mindfully</em>, by Susan Albers, use mindfulness-based psychological practices to take charge of cravings so they can eat when they are hungry and stop when they feel full. Ten years after the release of the first edition, this book continues to help thousands of readers change the way they approach mealtime. So what&#x2019;s changed? For starters, there is a new section that focuses on the &#x201c;occasional mindless eater.&#x201d; This second edition emphasizes that mindful eating isn&#x2019;t only for those on a diet or for those who have severely problematic eating habits&#x2014;it&#x2019;s for everyone. In addition, this new edition features over 50 new tips for eating mindfully. Inside, you will learn how to be more aware of what you eat, get to know your fullness and hunger cues, and how to savor and appreciate every bite. You will also learn how mindlessness corrupts the way you eat, and how it can manifest in a number of different eating problems.

She lives in New York City.</p><b>Introduction<br></b><br> About ten years ago, my big brother lived in a sixth-floor walk-up in Little Italy. We were very close, but we didn&#x2019;t talk about how much we loved each other. I don&#x2019;t know many brothers and sisters who do. But I think he knew. And I think the desserts helped.<br><br> If I close my eyes, I can still picture him bounding down the stairs to meet me at the front door of his apartment building. He&#x2019;d run down with a big smile, curly hair tousled, and still in his pajama bottoms after a day spent furiously working on one of his graphic design projects from home. I never felt like climbing his stairs, but I often had deliveries for him. This time, I had made a towering chocolate cream pie the night before and I knew he would want a slice. At least, I knew I wanted to bring him one.<br><br> That was our ritual. I would experiment with desserts and Mohan would eat them&#x2014;whatever the results. When I lived in Brooklyn and he lived in Manhattan, we would make the handoff over dinner at a restaurant near one of our offices. After the tonkatsu or the lasagna had been cleared away, Mohan would sneak bites of my latest triumph&#x2014;a flaky plum galette, or maybe a custardy bread pudding&#x2014;surreptitiously from under the table while we talked.<br><br> Sometimes, if we didn&#x2019;t have time for a meal, we&#x2019;d just pick a convenient street corner. We didn&#x2019;t even need to talk much. Meet at Sixth Avenue and West Fourth Street, a kiss on the cheek, a quick transfer of cookie-filled Tupperware, and we&#x2019;d be on our respective ways.<br><br> When I moved to the neighborhood next to his in Manhattan, I could just pop by his apartment anytime and meet him at the bottom of his stairs. My culinary school was just around the corner. On my way home from school, around 11:30 or midnight, I would call him up with a two-minute warning so he could run down to meet me to get something sweet.<br><br> After he died, I spent nights awake wondering if he knew how much he mattered to me. I&#x2019;m sure I hadn&#x2019;t said the words enough. But handing him a big slab of pie or a stack of cookies felt like saying &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d; I hope he heard me.<br><br> Homemade desserts have a big job: they carry important messages to important people. We bake them with the people we love. We share them with the people we love. We eat them with the people we love. But these days, we are told over and over again that one of the principal ingredients of dessert is deadly. The abundance of processed sugar in our diets is a serious health problem. Experts say that sugar is toxic. Some doctors claim that sugar should be grouped with cigarettes and alcohol as a harmful, addictive substance. Sugar has been linked to heart and liver damage, hypertension, and even cancer. Everyone knows that we eat too much of it. According to the American Heart Association, the average American consumes about twenty-two teaspoons of sugar a day. That&#x2019;s about thirteen more teaspoons than their recommended limit. If that&#x2019;s true, then it&#x2019;s no wonder so many of us are left wondering, <i>Should I bake with my children? Should I give sweets as holiday gifts? What should I serve to the people I love? What should we do about dessert?<br></i><br> What&#x2019;s even worse is that all this sugar has defeated its own purpose. Too much sugar is causing not only a health crisis but also a deliciousness crisis. Our desserts have become boring, uninspired sugar-bombs, sweetness drowning out everything else that&#x2019;s good. The flood of sugar has diluted real flavor, muffled complexity, and concealed true richness. Too often these days&nbsp;our sweets are <i>merely</i> sweet, and sweetness is the only standard a dessert must meet.<br><br> My goal in writing this book was to answer the questions that were troubling me: How can we make desserts better? More delicious? Healthier? Better for sharing? How should we bake for the people we love?<br><br> How can we make the conclusion of meals more interesting, coffee breaks more exciting, and (dare I say?) life itself more satisfying? The answer was in my cupboard all along: spice!<br><br> To get somewhere new, I go back to the past. There was a time when sugar was not ubiquitous and all-powerful, but instead was simply considered one of the spices people used to flavor their foods, satisfy their cravings, and enrich their lives. Before sugar became dominant, the very thought of cinnamon captivated imaginations, governed desires, and made tastes. The flavor and aroma of cloves drove trade, exploration, even war. According to legend, Eden had a scent&#x2014;cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.<br><br> And so with <i>The New&nbsp;Sugar and Spice, </i>I wanted to explore a broader spectrum of complementary tastes and flavors, and to reimagine beloved classics as a more balanced blend of sugar and spice. In these recipes, I&#x2019;ve tried to take down the sugar to bring up the flavor. I think that less sweet leaves more room for delicious. This book is about making dessert, and the love we share through it, that much more enjoyable and, in turn, a bit better for us, too.<br><br> Of course, these are desserts, and sugar is important to baking&#x2014;not only for flavor but also for texture, color, and aroma. These aren&#x2019;t necessarily low-sugar desserts. But in each recipe, I&#x2019;ve used what I believe to be just enough sugar necessary for the best possible experience. In some cases, that isn&#x2019;t very much. In others, it&#x2019;s more. My aim is to make spice an equal partner with sugar, open up&nbsp;a new world of homemade deliciousness, and create new cravings for something other than mass-produced sweetness.<br><br> The recipes themselves also tell stories&#x2014;my own family stories. My parents are from Sri Lanka, the island that some thought held the Garden of Eden itself. I can believe it. Sri Lanka was once one of the most coveted islands on the planet thanks to its fertile land and cinnamon groves&#x2014;it is the native home of true cinnamon, the species known as <i>Cinnamomum verum</i>. But not only cinnamon grows there. When I was growing up, I heard stories about my great-grandmother tending the clove trees that grew thirty feet tall outside her house in the mountains and produced bushels of spice to sell. My grandfather taught my dad how to hand-pollinate their vanilla orchids with a piece of coconut straw pulled from a broom. To me, Sri Lanka was a paradise and a home away from home. I spent some of the most joyful days of my childhood there, helping my grandmother&#x2019;s cook, Tikiri, gather spices from the garden and prepare steaming curries over fire and wood in an open hearth. Back in suburban Connecticut, where I grew up, I ate my fill of chocolate chip cookies, apple pie, and cinnamon buns, along with plenty of cake and brownies from mixes, happily indulging in all the sweet conveniences of my parents&#x2019; chosen home. But in Sri Lanka, I realized food comes from the earth. There I learned how to eat with my hands and my heart.<br><br> The seeds of this book were planted in these distinct places many years ago and grew into an idea while I was working as a magazine food editor, recipe developer, and food stylist in New York City. The result is a tribute to the cozy desserts of my childhood, the American classics that we all know and love, plus a little hint of the exotic in the form of spice.<br><br> Now instead of just hankering for a sweet piece of cake, I&#x2019;m drawn to the spices themselves. On a cold snowy day, something with the bright, spicy heat of ginger might call to me. I know that the smell of cardamom instantly brightens my mood, especially when it&#x2019;s cozied up to chocolate. When I have a heap of fresh summer fruit warming in the sun on my kitchen counter, I reach for cinnamon or vanilla, always crowd-pleasers. The pleasures of sugar and spice together have eclipsed my desire for simply sweet.<br><br> The recipes are organized by spice. Some desserts in a designated chapter might use more than one spice, but I&#x2019;ve slotted these treats by the flavor that most defines them. If you want the toasty, lemony essence of nutmeg, you know where to turn. And when you&#x2019;re feeling adventurous, flip to the spices that you&#x2019;re less familiar with. Follow your cravings through the book and discover new ones along the way!<br><br> I have developed the recipes that follow to bring back to life the power of the spices that once drove global history, and to look for a new way forward. I hope they will make all your traditional favorites feel like new discoveries. And most importantly, I hope you will be excited to share your creations, made with love and sugar and spice, with the people most important to you.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>spiced coffee custard<br><br></b>Serves 4<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1 tablespoon freshly <br> grated nutmeg, plus more for sprinkling<br> 4 large egg yolks<br> 1&#x2044;4 cup sugar<br> 4 teaspoons instant espresso powder<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br><br> I started drinking coffee at a young age. The way Sri Lankans make it, with plenty of sugar and creamy milk, it had real kid appeal. Instead of giving me an entire cup, my dad would tip a little of his hot coffee into his saucer for me. <br><br> Like a caffeine-hungry kitten, I would slurp it up.&nbsp;<br><br> These puddings have all the same appeal as those saucers of coffee did back them. Cool, sweet, and smooth coffee-flavored custard with a hint of spice. If you want to be cheeky, you can use pretty ovenproof coffee mugs or teacups instead of ramekins.<br><br> Preheat the oven to 325�F. Have ready four 6- to 8-ounce ramekins set in a metal baking pan. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and set aside.<br><br> In a small saucepan, combine 11&#x2044;2 cups of the heavy cream, the milk, and the nutmeg over medium-high heat. Cook until bubbles form around the edge of the pan, just before boiling, stirring occasionally. Remove the pot from the heat.<br><br> Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, espresso powder, and salt. Add some of the hot cream mixture to the yolk mixture while whisking. Repeat this process a few times until the two are completely combined. Divide the custard mixture evenly among the ramekins. Add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake until the custards are just set but still jiggle when nudged, 25 to 30 minutes. (Keep an eye on them; you might have to take some out before the others are done.)<br><br> Use tongs to transfer the ramekins from the hot water to a rack to cool. Empty the baking pan of water and let cool. Set the ramekins back in the pan, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 6 hours or up to 2 days. To serve, whip the remaining 1&#x2044;2 cup of cream to soft peaks. Top each custard with some whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.</p><h2>Concentration Exercises</h2><p>THESE EXERCISES FOR EVERY DAY OF THE MONTH WILL DEVELOP YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS; THEY WILL INFLUENCE THE DIRECTION OF YOUR LIFE&#39;S EVENTS IN A POSITIVE WAY; THEY WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE PERFECT HEALTH AND BE IN TUNE WITH THE PULSE OF THE UNIVERSE I recommend that you find time in your daily schedule to acquire the techniques and do the exercises offered below.

However, within the first few minutes I was pleasantly surprised and, as I read on, this book maintained a deep interest all the way through, chapter by chapter.</p><p><i>Feel Free to Prosper</i> is one of the most complete encyclopedias for prosperity consciousness I have ever come across.</p><p>In a matter of a few words, I would describe <i>Feel Free to Prosper</i> as the &#x201c;Modern Day Neville Goddard.&#x201d;</p><p>For many years now I&#x2019;ve studied, applied, experienced, written about, spoken on, and taught the principles of prosperity consciousness. There have been many teachers that have come across my path, and after reading thousands of books on the subject, purchasing and listening to thousands of audios, and attending countless programs all over the world, I have come to know the true authentic and effective books, audios, programs, and material.</p><p>The great news is that you don&#x2019;t have to invest years or even decades looking for the most influential and effective ideas and principles to create more abundance in your life. You need look no further than the pages of this great masterpiece.</p><p>Prosperity isn&#x2019;t something you &#x201c;get to&#x201d;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is something you already are.</p><p>My recommendation to you, dear reader, is to dig into this book with great hunger and thirst.

This is the promise of <i>Feel Free to Prosper: Two Weeks to Unexpected Income with the Simplest Prosperity Laws Available</i>, a simple, fast, and practical how-to approach to prosperity. And it is not a promise made lightly. It&#x2019;s a bold promise I make to you&#x2014;and one that I intend to keep.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not magic. But it may seem magical because the exquisite simplicity of the prosperity laws is not commonly understood. Human nature tends to complicate matters that appear abstract and beyond our reach.</p><p>I overcame my own severe &#x201c;lack&#x201d; consciousness to create a business that, for two decades, attracted the world&#x2019;s largest corporate clients by using the same prosperity principles that I now share with my students internationally and that I am about to share with you. Marilyn Jenett Locations, my one-woman special event company, evolved and was sustained over the years solely through the application of these prosperity laws and what I refer to as &#x201c;synchronicity and guidance.&#x201d; With the wisdom gained from my experiences in life and business, and through the inspired intuition that created this material, I am passionate about teaching you how to &#x201c;have the Universe on speed dial&#x201d; through my amazingly simple, easy-to-grasp, and practical Feel Free to Prosper teachings.</p><p>There is a vital need for the world&#x2019;s population to understand the underlying cause of personal financial distress: a belief that there is a separation from the true source of their supply&#x2014;what I call our &#x201c;invisible means of support.&#x201d; With my teachings, you will finally overcome the fear and experience proof of your alignment with the universal parent that is ready to shower each of us with gifts that are far beyond our imaginings&#x2014;once we learn how to receive.</p><p>The book you are about to read was never intended to be a book. The content was written online over several years in my characteristic conversational tone. Its purpose was to inspire my students and followers with the knowledge I had acquired while applying the works of the most brilliant teachers of mental and spiritual laws, starting almost forty years ago. My own teaching methods and proprietary techniques allow you to bypass the analytical mind and gently influence the subconscious, thereby connecting with the ultimate and unlimited source of abundant supply and knowledge. I am constantly told that my unique teaching style and ability to communicate what was previously considered esoteric knowledge into the simplest ideas is the key to the successful results my students achieve.</p><p>Why two weeks? From my decades of study of the mind, I knew that it was commonly accepted that it took three to four weeks to break a habit and create a new mental pattern. However, from the time I began teaching my Feel Free to Prosper program, I noticed that my average student achieved a breakthrough in two weeks&#x2014;often much sooner. I later heard that current psychological research showed it could take as little as two weeks to begin creating a new neural pathway in the brain. My students have been consistently right on cue. Quite simply, the techniques work, and they work fast.</p><p>The fulfillment of my promise and your two-week adventure will officially launch when you apply the legendary Feel Free to Prosper lesson material at the end of this book. But the chapters leading up to that program will not only jump-start your prosperity&#x2014;they will prepare you well for the main ride. Feel Free to Prosper is not a band-aid. It&#x2019;s a cure.</p><p><i>Feel Free to Prosper</i> is by no means intended to be just a typical tutorial or &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; book. My loftiest aspiration is to connect with you, my reader, in an uncommon way. I wish to instill in you my own faith and conviction in these laws, making you feel mentally&#x2014;even spiritually&#x2014;&#x201c;at home,&#x201d; inspiring you to embrace and apply the nuggets in each lesson for your happiness and success.</p><p>Common Ground</p><p>Many of the books on the market today are designed to establish expertise and attract readers to high-priced seminars and products. I don&#x2019;t find anything wrong with that. However, I have a special place in my heart for the millions of people for whom such offerings are out of reach. I recall this quote by Abraham Lincoln: &#x201c;God must have loved the common man because he made so many of them.&#x201d;</p><p>In my heart, I consider myself the &#x201c;common man&#x2019;s prosperity teacher,&#x201d; although successful professionals are equally at home with my material. My student base consists largely of entrepreneurs, &#x201c;solo-preneurs,&#x201d; and businesspeople, but my special mission is to help those whose &#x201c;containers&#x201d; (consciousness) are not yet large enough for pricey offerings. They are most urgently reaching out for answers and can benefit profoundly from the right book, as I&#x2014;a common woman&#x2014;once did.</p><p>The Teachings and the Gift</p><p>This book is organized into several primary parts. The chapters within each section contain material that I have written spontaneously&#x2014;and intuitively&#x2014;for my students and followers since creating Feel Free to Prosper. Little did I know that the Universe was actually dictating the chapters for my future book. Later in the book, inspiring stories in my students&#x2019; own words provide a testament to the power of these teachings and the universal laws.</p><p>The chapters within each part are not necessarily in an order meant to be followed sequentially, so you may refer to them for reinforcement or review at any time based on the subject and title.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll find in a few instances that I&#x2019;ve repeated certain wording in different chapters. That&#x2019;s because those items pertain to each of those chapters. Additionally, the repetition will help your subconscious mind accept these important points.</p><p>You may notice that I don&#x2019;t emphasize the term &#x201c;law of attraction&#x201d; and other buzzwords that have become mainstream in recent years. That&#x2019;s because my studies of the laws spanned several decades and I created Feel Free to Prosper several years before those concepts became popular. With due respect to the modern wave of teachers, I want the world to remember those brilliant icons who came before us&#x2014;the legendary teachers who influenced me the most and whose legacy I now wish to honor.</p><p>While the main subject of this book is learning how to achieve financial prosperity, you will find that the principles can be easily adapted to other areas of your life. The teachings in Part One provide the perfect foundation to apply the universal laws and prosperity principles for any purpose.</p><p>The knowledge and wisdom shared throughout this book culminate in my final gift that will fulfill my promise: I am including my <b>Feel Free to Prosper program lesson that relates to my &#x201c;two-week&#x201d; promise</b>, along with access to the recording of the companion group mentoring session. This is the proprietary lesson material that has resulted in strikingly fast results for my students. When you apply the program, it&#x2019;s important to follow my lesson instructions exactly and in the sequence presented for your greatest results. You will be firmly grounded on your path to prosperity and will experience the exhilaration of finally achieving the key to manifesting&#x2014;both the expected and unexpected.</p><p>Testimonials from the Feel Free to Prosper program come from men and women from all walks of life across the globe. You will be joining my students, who include business owners and employees, entrepreneurs, working moms, sales agents, professionals, job seekers, coaches, healers, retirees, artists, entertainers, and even an Olympic champion.</p><p>Overcoming the Resistance of the Subconscious Mind</p><p>There is a multitude of self-help and get-rich material in the marketplace available to those interested in improving their lives and increasing their prosperity. People bounce from one book or program to the next looking for results, but instead they often meet with frustration because the &#x201c;law of attraction&#x201d; tools being touted simply don&#x2019;t offer enough.</p><p>My students get the results they are looking for&#x2014;and get them quickly&#x2014;because my teachings address a critical component and missing link that most other books and programs do not: overcoming the resistance of the subconscious mind.</p><p>The reason most people, even those who are well versed in attraction and prosperity laws, do not manifest easily comes down to the resistance of the subconscious mind. If your subconscious mindset is not in alignment with your conscious desires, and you use law-of-attraction-type techniques to try and achieve life changes, you will automatically revert back to the tangible evidence of your own core beliefs. And it is those subconscious core beliefs which keep you stuck in &#x201c;lack&#x201d; rather than prosperity, whether we are talking about income, health, or abundance in any other forms.</p><p>Through what I call &#x201c;friendly persuasion,&#x201d; my Feel Free to Prosper students learn&#x2014;and now you will learn&#x2014;to use my special techniques and the power of words to persuade rather than argue with the subconscious. In <i>Feel Free to Prosper</i> and the included lesson program<i>,</i> you&#x2019;ll learn specific techniques that gently coerce the subconscious mind to accept a new dominant thought. This shift in thinking then creates the fertile soil of the subconscious which allows the new ideas of wealth, health, abundance, and success to take root. Most importantly, the Feel Free to Prosper techniques will bridge the gap between having an intellectual grasp of the prosperity principles&#x2014;which many people do, but to no avail&#x2014;and instilling a subconscious acceptance of them.</p><p>Advertisers have known for a long time that the subconscious mind responds to ideas that are simple and to the point. <i>Feel Free to Prosper </i>teaches these universal laws and prosperity principles in the simplest practical terms, thereby inspiring and guiding you toward the success you desire.</p><p>The Universe&#x2014;Your Marketing Department</p><p>If you own a business or want to advance in your job or career, then an entire section of this book is devoted to you.</p><p>Just as a house cannot stand without a proper foundation, all of the marketing, sales, and business know-how in the world will not result in success unless you first have the internal foundation&#x2014;the mindset&#x2014;to succeed. Once you create that foundation, you will automatically be guided to all the appropriate elements that will result in your success. You will be guided to do exactly what needs to be done to get your results. Or you may be guided to take no physical action&#x2014;except to watch as results arrive miraculously out of the blue. (I know you&#x2019;ll love that part of these teachings.)</p><p>As a reader of<i> Feel Free to Prosper</i>, you will learn that when you &#x201c;put the Universe on speed dial&#x201d; you will truly have the greatest marketing department you could ever hope for&#x2014;and that the possibilities are unlimited.</p><p>There is no question in my mind that the use of prosperity principles&#x2014;based on mental and spiritual laws&#x2014;is by far the most valuable way to market your business, achieve ongoing success in your business or career, and achieve success in every aspect of life. You can &#x201c;prosper&#x201d; in finances, in health, in love and relationships, in creativity and spiritually. As my greatest teacher, Dr. Joseph Murphy, used to say and that I now tell my students, &#x201c;Do the homework and you&#x2019;ll get the results.&#x201d;</p><p>Synchronicity and Guidance</p><p>Achieving prosperity is not just about visualizing and attracting what you want, as many books and programs would have you believe. By gently coercing the subconscious to accept the new dominant thought, we are able to create our &#x201c;pipeline&#x201d; to and tap into the universal source of supply&#x2014;and spontaneously attract and be guided to results which are far beyond what our limited, finite minds can imagine or visualize. My journey of successfully using these teachings to become the constant recipient of striking and unexpected gifts from this universal source is well documented in my manuscript <i>Feel Free to Prosper: An Entrepreneurial Memoir of Synchronicity and Guidance</i>. The memoir was written entirely online on my former social media forum and attracted tens of thousands of views. Then came literary agents and book offers based on my teachings, which ultimately led to my publisher and the book you are reading.</p><p>Early in my career as a special event specialist, with no PR or marketing resources and using only my prosperity principles and the &#x201c;universe as my publicist,&#x201d; I manifested a cover feature story in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> that attracted thousands of telephone calls for years and syndication around the world. This was followed by local and national prime-time television segments and continuing media exposure,...</p></p><h2>The Edmund Fitzgerald: Song of the Bell</h2><p>Leaving port from Superior, Wisconsin on a sunny November day, the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald is looking forward to a routine crossing of deep Lake Superior. Heading for a port in Cleveland, the giant transport ship is loaded with ore that will be used to build cars. But disaster is building in the wind as a gale storm begins to track after the great ship. This suspenseful retelling of the last hours of the doomed vessel pays homage to all sailors who traverse deep waters, in fair skies and foul. Atmospheric paintings from award-winning artist Gijsbert van Frankenhuyzen bring the story to life.The author of the best-selling books The Legend of Sleeping Bear and The Legend of Mackinac Island, Kathy-jo Wargin aims to help young readers notice the most intricate details of a story by adding the nuances that create magic and wonder in a good tale. She lives in the woods of northern Michigan with her family. The Edmund Fitzgerald is her 10th book with Sleeping Bear Press. Born in the Netherlands, Gijsbert van Frankenhuyzen, or &#34;Nick&#34; as he prefers to be known, studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in Holland. He immigrated to the United States in 1976. The Edmund Fitzgerald is Nick&#39;s 13th children&#39;s book with Sleeping Bear Press. The Legend of Sleeping Bear was Nick&#39;s first book and has sold more than 200,000 copies.</p><p>Kathy-jo Wargin is the author of more than 45 books and has earned national acclaim through award-winning children&#39;s classics such as Michigan&#39;s official state book, The Legend of Sleeping Bear, Children&#39;s Choice Award winner The Legend of the Loon, The Edmund Fitzgerald: Song of the Bell, and many others. Kathy-jo enjoys writing about nature, folklore, and its effect on all our lives. She is a frequent guest speaker and presenter for associations, school districts, and conferences throughout the country. She lives in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Kindergarten-Grade 3--A picture book about the sinking of the cargo ship Edmund Fitzgerald during a storm on Lake Superior in 1975. The vessel's bell, which eventually became a memorial to the lost sailors, is the focal point of the narrative. Tension builds steadily as the story unfolds. Members of the crew are introduced by name, and the fictionalized dialogue makes the story more immediate and true to life. Conversation, largely between Captain McSorley and the captain and first mate of the Arthur M. Anderson, another ship on the lake at the time, is undocumented. A poem interspersed throughout the text creates a sentimental, disjointed effect. Endpapers list names, positions, and hometowns of the men, and an afterword by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society describes how the bell was retrieved and became a memorial. Paintings show the movement and danger of the lake, and different angles are used to capture the drama of the tragedy. This title should be considered an additional purchase where there is regional demand.--Debbie Stewart, Grand Rapids Public Library, MI <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Even the diffident freshman, prone to keeping a new subject like philosopher as arm&#x2019;s length, will feel the enchantment of love-for-wisdom that philosophy is supposed to be.&#x201d; &#x2013; Joseph W.

His baseball cap, which he customarily wore with the bill turned back, faced forward. He needed all the disguise he could find. His spirits had fallen to the level of his dragging shoelaces.<p></p><p></p> His mind played back the pain of his failure. He grimaced as he recalled hurling down his bat. Then he had irrationally blamed the swirl of dust that kicked up just as he swung through the third pitch and ended the game, 5&#x2013;4.<p></p><p></p> "Stupid dust!" he had yelled. He scrubbed his eyes to make his point. But his teammates, who had been clinging hopefully to the chain-link fence, just groaned and began to gather their equipment.<p></p><p></p> Now, to make himself feel better, Mickey bought food and drink. The owner of the store was a friend of his father&#x2019;s, so the boy was allowed to ignore the scrawled sign above the magazine rack that read: BUY THE MAGAZINE&#x2014;DON&#x2019;T JUST READ IT.<p></p><p></p> He was eyeballing the latest issue of Lowrider magazine when a man whispered, "Oye, kid, you need work?" Mickey jumped, startled not by the man breathing down on him&#x2014;and the fact that he was tattooed to his throat&#x2014;but by the word he despised most of all. Work. As in pick up a shovel? he thought. As in weed the flower bed? As in get an old towel from the garage and wash the car?<p></p><p></p> "What?" Mickey asked weakly. "Did you say . . . work?"<p></p><p></p> The man&#x2019;s eyes were small in his large face, but that was the only thing small about him: He was barrel-chested, with muscle-packed shoulders and huge arms and legs. He stood just a few inches taller than Mickey, but much mightier.<p></p><p></p> "Yeah, kid, I&#x2019;m looking for someone to help me move things. I&#x2019;m paying good&#x2014;thirty dollars&#x2014;if you can spare a couple hours."<p></p><p></p> The man had to retrieve items from his grandfather&#x2019;s house. Old Gramps, the man quipped, had eaten too much menudo in his time and had suffered a heart attack. He touched his heart, and then the gold dollar sign that dangled from a large gold chain around his neck.<p></p><p></p> Mickey, seeing that this hombre was connected to a larger economy than the two quarters in his own pocket, became interested. At home he slaved for nothing&#x2014;or next to nothing, just a dollar or two. Now this man was offering Mickey thirty bucks.<p></p><p></p> "How long will it take?"<p></p><p></p> "Not long," the man answered. "You&#x2019;re a strong-looking dude."<p></p><p></p> Mickey inflated his chest and held the air as long as he could before slowly releasing it. "Okay," he agreed.<p></p><p></p> He finished his soda and crushed the can in his fist, which made the man whistle and say, "You&#x2019;re strong, I&#x2019;m telling you." Mickey smiled proudly and again inflated his chest.<p></p><p></p> Soon Mickey was in an old squeaky truck moving down Fruit Street. He noticed the radio was gone. "Your truck get jacked?"<p></p><p></p> "What?"<p></p><p></p> Mickey pointed at the cavern full of loose wires.<p></p><p></p> "Yeah," the man muttered, head shaking in disgust. "These be bad times. People just taking what they want." He scratched a tattoo that read born to lose on his bicep. "But you know what the worst theft is?"<p></p><p></p> Mickey shook his head.<p></p><p></p> "It&#x2019;s when someone steals your soul."<p></p><p></p> Profound, Mickey thought. The dude sounds like my dad when he&#x2019;s kicking it in his recliner and complaining about the government.<p></p><p></p> The man introduced himself as Raul.<p></p><p></p> "I got a friend at school named Raul," Mickey said. "Him and me want to start a rock group."<p></p><p></p> "Is that right?" Raul asked. "What instrument you play?"<p></p><p></p> "Nothing right now, but we&#x2019;re going to learn."<p></p><p></p> "I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re gonna make it. And if not in music, then in sports. Bet you play ball, huh?"<p></p><p></p> Mickey beamed. "Yeah, actually, I play slow-pitch." His recent outing, he figured, had been a fluke. The stupid dust messed him up&#x2014;dust and everyone looking at him from the dugout.<p></p><p></p> Mickey spied a car approaching from the opposite direction. It was his father&#x2019;s car. A zipper of fear ran up his back. What would his father think of his son in a truck driven by a total stranger? He was only thirteen. Or would his father be proud that he had found work?<p></p><p></p> "Is this place far?" Mickey felt nervous. "My mom likes me to be home by five." He caught sight of a tattoo in Lowrider script, carlos, on the guy&#x2019;s wrist. Which is it? Mickey wondered. Raul or Carlos?<p></p><p></p> "Nah, it&#x2019;s just right around here," Raul answered.<p></p><p></p> The truck turned a corner. They were in a nice part of their small city, with flowers standing up in well-fertilized soil and sharing their pretty faces with passersby. Automatic sprinklers were spinning out water on supergreen lawns.<p></p><p></p> "It&#x2019;s one of these," Raul said. He peered out the windshield splotched with the horrible deaths of insects.<p></p><p></p> Mickey was certain his widowed aunt lived on this street. Her husband had died while ordering a hamburger. This was just about all he remembered about his uncle, a baker who went to bed before the good television programs started and got up while it was still night.<p></p><p></p> Raul searched for a house, braked, backed the truck up a few feet, and crept into the driveway, cutting the engine and letting the truck roll until it stopped. The house was near the corner, and its lawn sparkled from a recent soaking. A flag with smiling bunnies and turtles on it hung by the door.<p></p><p></p> "Your grandfather lives here?" To Mickey, the house didn&#x2019;t seem very Mexican, and Raul, dark as a penny, was puro homie.<p></p><p></p> "That&#x2019;s right. You wait here &#x2019;cause I got to go around the back and get the key." Raul jumped out of the truck and disappeared through a gate at the side of the house.<p></p><p></p> Mickey wrote his name on the dusty dashboard, then leaped from the truck. Before he slammed the door, he noticed six or seven cell phones under the passenger&#x2019;s seat, maybe more. Was Raul a thief?<p></p><p></p> "Dang," he whispered. Was he, a tender seventh grader, being pulled into a crime that would send him to juvie until he was seventeen? By then, his voice would have deepened like a frog&#x2019;s.<p></p><p></p> Mickey didn&#x2019;t dwell on this question because Raul had appeared on the porch. "Come on, champ," he called with a wave. Somehow, Mickey couldn&#x2019;t disappoint this guy&#x2014;he was sort of cool with all his tattoos.<p></p><p></p> Once inside the house, he was greeted by cool air, a tidy living room, and bright artificial flowers in a vase. Raul closed the door behind them and pointed to a huge television. Mickey whistled. It could have been an altar in a church because a cross and a picture of Jesus sat on top.<p></p><p></p> "We&#x2019;re going to move this?" Mickey sidled up to the television and perceived that it was taller than he.<p></p><p></p> "Yeah, that&#x2019;s why I need you, champ." Mickey sensed Raul was trying to stroke him with a compliment. Still, he wasn&#x2019;t about to confront him and ask, "Hey, dude, you a thief? How come you got a tattoo that says Carlos?"<p></p><p></p> It was just too late.<p></p><p></p> Raul unplugged the television, tossed the cross and picture of Jesus onto the couch, and started to wrestle the TV from the wall. Together they moved one end, then the other, and walked the monstrous television across the living room to the front door. During this straining effort Mickey laid his eyes on framed photographs on the wall. One was of an elderly white couple, and below them were photographs of pinkish children. A flood of sweat sprang to his face. The zippers of fear went crazy on his back.<p></p><p></p> Face moist with sweat, Raul pulled at the front of his tank top and fanned himself. "Go get me a soda."<p></p><p></p> "What?"<p></p><p></p> "In the kitchen. Grab me and you a cold one." Raul pulled out a white handkerchief and ran it across his face and neck.<p></p><p></p> It&#x2019;s stolen, Mickey reckoned. The handkerchief belongs to the old man in the picture. Raul was not the kind of guy who carried an ironed handkerchief white as snow. He must have cased the place&#x2014;were the old folks on vacation?&#x2014;and broken in, discovered a huge television on which to watch the Raiders in the fall, and recruited a naive soul in the shape of a thirteen-year-old strikeout king.<p></p><p></p> Be cool, Mickey reminded himself. He did what Raul asked and fetched two sodas. "Your grandfather is he, like, going to get better?" A split second later, he wished he could pull in that sentence like a fishing line. Why did he ask it?<p></p><p></p> Raul leveled a mean, snakelike stare at Mickey. The moment was so quiet that he could hear a leaky faucet drip in the kitchen.<p></p><p></p> Raul softened and answered, "Yeah, mi abuelito is gonna get better. The guy is strong, you know. He served in Nam and came back to pick grapes for fifteen years. Can you believe that?" He burped and added that his grandfather was a swell fellow who would give the shirt off his back.<p></p><p></p> "Times was hard then, huh?" Mickey thought of his own Mexican-born grandfather, who, according to family lore, walked five miles through a sandy desert to get to school. His grandfather, often lit with drink, reminded them every Christmas that he&#x2019;d only gone up to eighth grade. He wanted his grandchildren to study hard and get jobs in office buildings where the air conditioning was free.<p></p><p></p> "You got that right, homie." Raul downed his soda, tossed the empty can on the couch, and ordered, "Back to work. Got that twenty dollars waiting for you."<p></p><p></p> Miffed that Raul had lowered his pay, Mickey nearly braved correcting him. He would need the full thirty dollars to buy the aluminum bat he had eyed at Big 5.<p></p><p></p> But even more, he wanted out! He debated whether to sprint out the front door, screaming his fool head off, "Thief! Thief! Help me! Somebody help me!" He pictured himself running in slow motion, the way he did in dreams in which he was hauling as fast as he could to first base. He feared that Raul would chase him down. What would his headstone read? thirteen-year-old struck out in the first inning of life!<p></p><p></p> By the time they got the television down the steps and into the back of the truck, both were sweating. "Is that all?" Mickey asked. "You know, I could walk home from here." He pasted a smile on his mug. He spanked his palms together to portray a kid done with work.<p></p><p></p> "No, I need you to come and unload it. Wait here." From the porch Raul turned and pointed a warning finger. "Don&#x2019;t go anywhere! That ten dollars is going to be yours."<p></p><p></p> He&#x2019;s lowering my pay again! Mickey&#x2019;s jaw dropped in disbelief. Raul was a cheap thief.<p></p><p></p> The smart part of Mickey&#x2019;s brain advised, Run, sucka! Get your nalgas outta there! He took off, his arms chugging away, but he could swear he was running in slow motion. He looked back: Raul was nowhere in sight.<p></p><p></p><p></p> Copyright � 2008 by Gary Soto<p></p><p></p> All rights reserved.

What we can and cannot write, say, and do online is based on just one law&#x2015;a law that protects online services from lawsuits based on user content. Jeff Kosseff exposes the workings of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has lived mostly in the shadows since its enshrinement in 1996. Because many segments of American society now exist largely online, Kosseff argues that we need to understand and pay attention to what Section 230 really means and how it affects what we like, share, and comment upon every day.</p><p><i>The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet</i> tells the story of the institutions that flourished as a result of this powerful statute. It introduces us to those who created the law, those who advocated for it, and those involved in some of the most prominent cases decided under the law. Kosseff assesses the law that has facilitated freedom of online speech, trolling, and much more. His keen eye for the law, combined with his background as an award-winning journalist, demystifies a statute that affects all our lives &#x2013;for good and for ill. While Section 230 may be imperfect and in need of refinement, Kosseff maintains that it is necessary to foster free speech and innovation. </p><p>For filings from many of the cases discussed in the book and updates about Section 230, visit jeffkosseff.com</p></p><p><p>Jeff Kosseff is Assistant Professor in the US Naval Academy's Cyber Science department, where he teaches cybersecurity law.

Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District Court of Virginia. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting and the recipient of the George Polk Award in National Reporting.</p><p>"Americans are of two minds about the internet: They rely on it and fear it, they immerse themselves in it for hours and deplore its social consequences.... Jeff Kosseff's 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet' is in many ways the story of how and why this happened."</p> (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Kosseff has a thorough grasp of his material, and readers will find his exploration of Section 230 balanced, timely, and consistently thought-provoking."</p> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br><p>"Kosseff presents an insider's account of the current dispute over whether a website should be permitted to profit from publishing advertisements that sell illegal sexual services possibly performed by minors. This book is extremely timely as both US lawmakers and the nation's courts are struggling over the proper regulation of online hate speech, fake news, political bias, and other systematic manipulations employing this increasingly powerful form of communication."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Kosseff's book is timely, given the intensifying debate about whether Congress should find ways to hold Internet companies accountable for third-party speech that harms individuals and society as a whole. But the book's value goes beyond timing. The author's background as a journalist and his current roles as a professor and a lawyer enable him to produce an engaging narrative that explains the law clearly and compels us to think about speech in the modern age and who is responsible when it is harmful."</p> (<i>The Washington Post</i>)</p><h2>Mark Twain - U.S. History Maps, Grades 5 - 8</h2><p>Bring the action and adventure of U.S. history into the classroom with U.S. History Maps for grades 5 and up!

The problem is, because they&#x2019;re not genuine, your gut feeling will start to notice the discrepancies, the little white lies, when his words don&#x2019;t align with his actions. That&#x2019;s when the emotional rollercoaster ride starts.</p> <p>Men who play games, and as you&#x2019;ll see it&#x2019;s not only the player type who does this, know how to hang a carrot on a stick in front of a woman. You might think this only happens to not-so-intelligent women. It doesn&#x2019;t. Some of my clients have very high positions in international companies, household names, lawyers, surgeons, and so on. Yet they too fall for his games and step into his traps.</p> <p>Some of these men are smart. They are master conmen, master manipulators. Not all of them have bad intentions, as you&#x2019;ll learn; some simply don&#x2019;t know any better. They don&#x2019;t have the emotional intelligence that&#x2019;s needed to reveal their true selves.

The struggle, as Gray points out in <i>Starting Over</i>, isn't just to find a new partner, but to get over those feelings of abandonment or loss or anger or whatever else gets dredged up by the end of a relationship.<p> Perhaps the book's most crucial chapter posits that the best way to get over the loss of love is to focus on the "love" more than the "loss." That may seem impossible, especially if the bum took off with your best friend, your life savings, and your Lyle Lovett CDs, but Gray didn't get to be a household name because the advice in his Venus and Mars books doesn't work. Remembering only the bad parts, Gray says, leaves you with an important part of your emotional being closed to new business.</p><p> As for the Venus and Mars stuff, that comes in the second half of the book, when Gray looks at how men and women start new relationships from different points of view, with different priorities (a man might want to have fun with no strings attached; a woman might carry with her a lengthy list of requirements for her next partner, a list that excludes virtually all available men). </p><p> If you've never read Gray's work before, you have to be prepared to check your cynicism at the door. This is earnest stuff, but it's also based on decades of experience counseling clients. He's not one of those photogenic, nine-times-divorced shrinklets who's telling you how to conduct your relationships without any real clue of what makes love last. This is the real package: nothing glib, nothing quick and easy, nothing you could've figured out from a "Love Is..." cartoon.</p><p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities.

Mindfulness builds emotional intelligence, boosts happiness, increases curiosity and engagement, reduces anxiety and depression, soothes the pain of trauma, and helps kids (and adults) focus, learn, and make better choices. If that weren&#x2019;t enough, research now shows that mindfulness significantly enhances what psychologists call "flourishing"&#x2015;the opposite of depression and avoidance.</p><p><i>Growing Up Mindful </i>helps parents, educators, and counselors learn how to embody and share the skills of mindfulness that will empower our children with resilience throughout their lives. With more than 75 accessible exercises and practices, along with adaptations for the individual needs of a wide range of children and teens, this inspiring guidebook brings you road-tested insights and tools for: </p><p>� Tapping the power of the imagination, play, and creativity</p><br><br><p>� Body-based mindfulness and movement practices</p><br><br><p>� Creatively overcoming resistance and gaining kids&#x2019; buy-in</p><br><br><p>� The mindful use of technology and social media</p><br><br><p>� Building the foundation through your own personal practice</p><br><br><p>� "Attending" and "Befriending"&#x2015;two positive responses to stress</p><br><br><p>� Setting intentions and managing expectations of new practitioners</p><br><br><p>� Sharing mindfulness in a formal setting including schools and workplaces</p><br><br><p>� Extending our practice into the larger communities we share</p><p>"Seeds of mindfulness can be planted in anyone at any time&#x2015;seeds that under the right conditions can burst and bloom into a life of compassion and connection," writes Dr. Willard. <i>Growing Up Mindful</i> invites you to "embark on something incredible and world-changing" as you join the growing community of adults bringing wonder, curiosity, and reflection back into childhood and adolescence.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Willard, PsyD</b>, is a Boston-based clinical psychologist and educational consultant specializing in mindfulness and contemplative practices.

For more information, visit drchristopherwillard.com.<p>&#x201c;Willard (Mindfulness for Teen Anxiety), a clinical psychologist who advocates mindfulness as a stress relief practice, offers a helpful manual to introducing secular mindfulness practices to children and teens, as well as their parents. The book progresses from explaining mindfulness and its benefits, illustrated by helpful charts, to various strategies for introducing it to one&#x2019;s children. Speaking as a parent himself, Willard writes that it&#x2019;s imperative to 'cultivate our own practice.' He also cautions parents against raising the subject in the way that suggests to children 'that they are broken and in the need of fixing.' The better approach is to offer a practice that&#x2019;s compatible with a child&#x2019;s interests and fits into ongoing activities. To this end, he offers 101 'mindfulness cues' geared to children of different ages and temperaments, and discusses how mindfulness can be applied to actions as simple as eating and walking. On integrating mindfulness into play, the author says, 'The games our kids play... are practices for real life' and good preparation for becoming 'mindful and compassionate adults.'

Within that group half were women and a third were children. The remaining six to twelve were men. They gathered in the Men&#39;s Hut. It is in our genetic code to seek the hut, the place where we are free from our societal roles, where we can share our lives and be witnesses to our brothers. It is where our stories are told and where we find rest, support and kinship. Establishing or joining a Men&#39;s Group can return you to the hut. It&#39;s been many generations since most men have been there, hence the path to its re-establishment can be difficult. This manual has been designed as a map. Like any map, detours and deviations might be needed, but it will take you and your brothers back to a seat at the ancient circle of men.</p><p></p><h2>Old MacDino Had a Farm</h2><p>Old MacDino had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!

Although the book presumes EMDR training, it has considerable application for other clinicians who deal with the pernicious effects of early trauma and neglect in the attachment period. The book is based on the seminal contributions of Katie O&#39;Shea, and integrates the author&#39;s understanding of complex trauma, dissociative disorders, and the neurobiology of traumatic dissociation, including Panksepp, Porges, Schore, and others. It draws upon the somatic therapy traditions of Peter Levine and others for accessing the somatically held unprocessed trauma responses. Although primarily for clinicians, the cartoons are also suitable for use with clients. Like the author&#39;s first book on dissociation, the lay public will be interested in the book because its cartoons make the information comprehensible. The early trauma approach in its basic form consists of 1) containment, 2) safe state, 3) resetting hardwired subcortical affective circuits and 4) clearing trauma by time frame for temporal integration. For complex cases, each step has ego state variations and there are more preparatory steps to ensure the self system is aligned with treatment goals. It integrates ego state work to reduce loyalty to the aggressor and the problem of perpetrator introjects. The author was a collaborator of the late father of ego state therapy, John G. Watkins, Ph.D. Sandra Paulsen offers a third integration approach, &#34;temporal integration,&#34; to supplement the &#34;tactical integration&#34; and &#34;strategic integration&#34; approaches of Catherine Fine, Ph.D. and Richard Kluft, M.D., respectively. The book has over a hundred original drawings by the author, which telegraph complex psychological and neurobiological concepts quickly, making the book a quicker read than would otherwise be possible. The format, with its generous use of bullets, white space and cartoons, mean that a range of readers can scan the chapters for the information relevant to their own needs. Appendices provide detailed information on the mechanics of the work, how to ethically work in the intensive format, containment procedures for complex cases, working with perpetrator introjects. Although the book is informal with its use of cartoons, the book includes relevant scholarly citations and references. Because it is both metaphoric and scholarly, it speaks to both the right and left hemisphere&#39;s of the reader&#39;s brain. Many concepts will slip in unawares through the compelling use of metaphor. The book includes case examples to illustrate the suggested scripting for accomplishing each of the relevant steps. Narrative discussion describes the most likely problems for each step and what to do about them. Katie O&#39;Shea, M.S., is acknowledged as contributing author because of her development of the original approach and some of the ideas contained in the book. Ulrich Lanius, Ph.D. contributed to the neurobiological understandings in the book. Above all, the author&#39;s goal is to help others understand how the story tells itself non-verbally, when trauma occurs in the attachment period and is held in implicit memory. When we hear of the story in the non-verbals, clinicians can &#34;catch and release&#34; the traumatic sequelae of very early trauma and neglect. The book includes worksheets for clinicians use. It supplements the online workshops that Dr Paulsen presents on this same topic, and others, see www.bainbridgepsychology.com.</p><p>In addition to the present volume, Dr Paulsen authored, &#x201c;Looking Through the Eyes of Trauma &amp; Dissociation: An Illustrated Guide for EMDR Therapists and Clients,&#x201d; and Lanius, Paulsen, &amp; Corrigan, &#x201c;The Neurobiology and Treatment of Traumatic Dissociation:Toward an Embodied Self.&#x201d; She authored chapters in books by Forgash &amp; Copeley, "Healing the Heart of Trauma;" R.

She teaches workshops on ego state therapy, somatic methods, the early trauma approach and how the story tells itself non-verbally. Her clinical practice is limited to brief intensive work on a forested island near Seattle. Clients come from all over the world to work for several days, all day, to clear and repair trauma in the attachment period. She consults extensively to other mental health professionals on the use of EMDR with complex and dissociative clients. Her online workshops are available through sfrankelgroup.com.

So when his archenemy, Doctor Malevolent, turns him into a potato, Max's ego takes the hardest blow. Overcoming this hardship with a new potato-sized costume, he mashes Doctor Malevolent's plan to starch-ify the rest of the city. With the fiend at his mercy, the hero learns that turning potatoes back into people is impossible, which gives him a chance to prove that compassion is central to true heroism. The predicament also sets the character up for future, potato-shaped adventures. The art punches things up considerably, with well-constructed, flowing page layouts, humorously extreme reaction shots, and a stark and vibrant color palette that feels both classical and unique. <strong>If Loony Tunes was in the superhero business, this is something it might have baked up.</strong> A superhero romp with some age-appropriate examples of heroic behavior and a nonstop torrent of gags that work a decent portion of the time."&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em><br></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Super Max has a luxurious blond coiffure, a cape, big muscles (737, to be exact), and an outsized ego. So, it's humiliating when Doctor Malevolent shoots him with a new weapon and turns him into a potato. Now, he's Super Potato, a tiny figure with spindly arms and legs, and he's devastated: 'Super Potato cries like a baby surrounded by onions.' He still has superpowers, though, and once he rigs up a new costume for his potato-shaped self, he's ready to do battle with Doctor Malevolent (who looks like a slimmed-down Gru from <em>Despicable Me</em>) again. Super Patata has been available in Laperla's home of Spain for several years; this is its U.S. debut, and its uncredited English translation sounds natural and doesn't fumble. <strong>Laperla's parody strikes an easy comedic tone from the first page, and its wackiness unspools effortlessly.</strong> Full-color panel artwork combines caricature with handsomely drafted backgrounds of cityscapes and spaceships, and Laperla nails Super Potato's expressions of rage and exasperation. <strong>A promising start to a series with appeal to strong and reluctant readers alike.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Super Max is devoted to fighting crime, especially Dr. Malevolent, and looking good. When Super Max learns that Dr. Malevolent has stolen a priceless statue, he heads to his nemesis's not-so-secret hideout to retrieve it.

Laperla offers obvious and subtle humor, appealing to a variety of readers. Kids will get a kick out of the over-the-top action and enjoy watching Super Max come to accept his new role as a tiny tuber. The bright cartoons will draw in even the most reluctant readers, who will be happy to know that the series continues&#x2015;this volume ends with a call for Super Potato to capture yet another outlandish villain.

She lives in Rome with Gianluca and their daughter, Nina.</p>K-Gr 3&#x2014;In the mid-1800s, a gregarious gastronome named George Crum cooked for the people who visited Moon's Lake House in Saratoga Springs, NY. One day a particularly picky, punctilious customer requested a plateful of potatoes. Again and again, the customer, Mr. Filbert P. Horsefeathers, returned the potatoes to the kitchen, each time asking for thinner, tastier potatoes. In a final, exasperated effort, Crum sliced them as thinly as possible, fried them to a crisp, and then sprinkled them with an abundance of salt. What began as a joke ended with a food product still hugely popular today&#x2014;potato chips. The narrative, loosely based on the real story, is stuffed with meaty morsels of juicy, often alliterative big words like scrumptious, sublime, and succulent. The story begs to be read aloud so that listeners can savor the sound of the luscious language while picking up some very sophisticated, multisyllabic words. It could also be a good opportunity for children to conduct a readers' theater rendition&#x2014;with plenty of practice. While Mr. Horsefeathers comes across as a somewhat exaggerated figure for comedic effect, the notes and photographs at the book's end relate the real story behind Crum's legacy. The illustrations, done in watercolor and colored pencil, vividly convey the people and dress of the era. VERDICT This title has a lot of potential for classroom use for literacy development (prosody, vocabulary), reading aloud, and any study of food. Just say "potato chips" and students will be clamoring to read.&#x2014;Maggie Chase, Boise State University, ID</p><h2>The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight</h2><p><b>Quirks of timing feature in this romantic novel about family connections, second chances, and first loves.

Smith and Margaret Stohl</b> <p><em>Margaret Stohl is the bestselling author of the Beautiful Creatures series.</em></p> <p><strong>Margaret Stohl:</strong> Okay, Jen, it has to be asked: What&#x2019;s your own take on the statistical probability--or even the vague possibility--of love at first sight? More to the point, has it ever happened to you? Would you know if it had? Would any of us? I wonder...</p> <p><strong>Jennifer E. Smith:</strong> I&#x2019;d like to think it exists. I&#x2019;m an optimist and a romantic--both key ingredients for believing in this sort of thing. But for me, time is also such an important part of any relationship--time to get to know each other, time to share stories, time to grow--so it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that kind of instant connection. That said, I do know people who have experienced it firsthand, couples who have been together happily for a very long time, so it&#x2019;s hard to argue with that. I guess that anecdotally--if not statistically--it seems to be possible, and since I&#x2019;m in the business of telling stories rather than compiling statistics, that&#x2019;s good enough for me!</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> Your boy-meets-girl-meets-world happens on a flight across the Atlantic to Heathrow. My own teens are fencers, and we spend half our lives making that same flight for European tournaments. But why did you pick such an unusual setup? What&#x2019;s the backstory there for you?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> I suppose it could have been set on a flight headed anywhere, but there&#x2019;s something about flying at night that seemed like an interesting backdrop for this type of story. Unfortunately, I have a complete inability to fall asleep on planes, so I&#x2019;ve spent plenty of trips wide awake as the rest of the passengers doze off, and the cabin is always so hushed and dark and dreamlike during those hours. It seemed like the perfect setting for two people to get to know each other.</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> I&#x2019;ve had some of the strangest encounters of my life on planes. I&#x2019;ve met people who have read my books or drawn me a map of recommended towns in Southeast Asia or recounted their entire life stories. How about you? Was there an encounter that inspired this story?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> A few years ago, on a flight from Chicago to Dublin, I was seated next to a man from Ireland. He was reading a book that I loved, and we started chatting, and ended up talking for much of the flight. He was older--probably in his sixties--and there was nothing romantic about it, but it was nice to meet a kindred spirit, someone who loved books the way I do, and it made the hours pass quickly. When we arrived in Dublin, we walked off the plane together, but we ended up in separate lines for customs, since he was an Irish citizen. We didn&#x2019;t exactly say good-bye; I think we both thought we&#x2019;d see each other on the other side, but my line ended up being really slow, and when I finally made it through, he was gone. It was obviously a much different situation than the one in my book, but it definitely provided some of the initial inspiration for the story of Hadley and Oliver.</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> What about your worst in-flight experiences? Perhaps not involving children and bodily fluids...?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> Well, that narrows it down quite a bit! I&#x2019;ve had a few harrowing experiences involving turbulence, one emergency landing, and a couple of awfully long flights to places like South Africa and New Zealand. But I can&#x2019;t really complain too much. My worst experiences usually have to do with the fact that I can&#x2019;t sleep on planes, and while there&#x2019;s nothing quite like being wide awake for nine straight hours in a middle seat on a red-eye flight, I&#x2019;ve actually been pretty lucky in the grand scheme of things.</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> So much of our life is conducted in transit. We read on the subway or watch movies on trains or text someone on the way to work. What is <em>Statistical Probability</em> saying about the speed or the connectivity of modern life?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> I definitely think it&#x2019;s about slowing down and recognizing the possibilities. I&#x2019;m as guilty as anyone of moving too fast. If the love of my life sat down next to me on a plane, I&#x2019;m honestly not sure I&#x2019;d give him much of a chance. When I&#x2019;m traveling, I have my book and my music, and I&#x2019;m in my own little world. It&#x2019;s a good thing to remember to look up every once in a while. </p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> I loved the imperfect, fumbling family relationships in your novel; there was something so honest about your protagonist and her father. I identified with her fragmented emotions, with feeling two ways at once. How did you go about crafting such a layered character? Who do you identify with, on the page?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> I definitely identified the most with Hadley, the main character. It kind of amazes me how easily I&#x2019;m still able to see the world from the point of view of a seventeen-year-old. Maybe that&#x2019;s true of everyone. Maybe we all carry around a little piece of our former selves, the teenagers we once were. But I think YA authors must be particularly attuned to this; perhaps our inner seventeen-year-olds are just a little bit closer to the surface.</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> How is it, setting a story in modern-day London? Did you feel an obligation to get everything exactly "right"? Did you travel to the UK for research?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> I did my graduate degree in Scotland a few years ago, and while I was there, two of my best friends were studying in London. I went down to visit them pretty often, and spent a lot of time wandering around the city on my own, taking it all in. It was a few years before those experiences worked their way into my writing, but if I&#x2019;d never lived in the UK I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have ever written this book, so I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity, in more ways than one. I was also lucky to make some great friends over there, and one of them was nice enough to read a very early draft for me. I managed to get most things right, but she definitely caught me out on a few Americanisms--using yard instead of garden, for example--so I was happy to have a Scottish consultant!</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> Most writers are passionate readers; I know that the Dickens book <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> plays an important role in your story, just as <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> is significant in <em>Beautiful Creatures</em>. How often do books you&#x2019;ve read feed directly into books you write?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> I have a friend who refers to these as "book chains"--where you read one book and it leads you to another. As a passionate reader, I love when that happens. And as an author, what better way to highlight the books that have meant a lot to you? In college, my senior seminar was on Dickens, and so I read a lot of his work, but for some reason Our Mutual Friend was the one that really stuck with me. The quotes that I used in Statistical Probability are ones that I underlined in my old paperback edition of that book almost ten years ago, and I guess they never quite left me.</p> <p><strong>Stohl:</strong> What&#x2019;s the statistical probability of another young adult romance from Jen Smith? Anything we can do to improve the odds?</p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> The statistical probability is very, very good. I&#x2019;m actually working on another one right now, a love story called <em>This Is What Happy Looks Like</em>. So stay tuned!</p>Jennifer E. Smith is the author of <i>Hello, Goodbye, and Everything in Between</i>, <i>The Geography of You and Me</i>, <i>This Is What Happy Looks Like</i>, <i>The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight</i>, <i>The Storm Makers</i>, <i>You Are Here</i>, and <i>The Comeback Season</i>.

Visit her at AprilSayre.com.This striking photo essay engages curious readers as the world of snow is revealed in all of its frigid manifestations. Be it a shivering, huddled squirrel or a cardinal posing as a vermilion exclamation point within a maze of snow-laden branches, the frost-flecked forest creatures gazing forth from Sayre's compelling compositions contrast perfectly with the stark descriptions. "A freeze. / A breeze. / A cloud. / It snows." The economically precise language entices and beguiles in a rhyming progression that accompanies a series of photos that range from dark gray clouds to drifting snowflakes to a brittle pane of ice fractals. The photos are stunning. Two red-winged blackbirds are captured in midair, about to land on a feeder; snowflakes on a red squirrel's coat stand out in a double-page-dominating close-up; individual drops of water are captured melting from ice-encrusted fir needles. Stealthily introduced science concepts unfurl amid a visual symphony of meteorological splendor. The appended science facts perfectly accompany each line of poetry reproduced from the body of the text, harmoniously blending the author's twin disciplines of science and creative writing. A lesson-enriching bibliography is also provided. Adult companions of young explorers will find in Sayre's latest nature study an ideal vehicle for early STEAM curricula and activities at home or in school. (Informational picture book. 3-8) -- Kirkus Reviews *STARRED REVIEW*, <i>8/1/16</i><br><br>In this visually stunning tribute to winter weather, Sayre explores the water cycle through photography and verse. In the opening lines, a freeze and a breeze combine to produce feathery snowflakes that drift down from the sky and &#x201c;land on a squirrel&#x2019;s nose.&#x201d; Flowing from page to page, the alliterative rhyming text describes the characteristics and behavior of the frozen precipitation. Evocative photos of winter landscapes and wildlife quietly capture the serene beauty of a forest blanketed in snow. &#x201c;Snow sails&#x201d; around an orange-beaked female cardinal, and &#x201c;it settles&#x201d; on a scattering of fallen brown leaves. Coming full circle, a freeze and a breeze conjure a storm and it snows once again, frosting bare branches with sparkling white. Sayre&#x2019;s simple text and in particular her eye-catching photos celebrate the wonder and magic of the natural world. Appended back matter that explains the snowflake&#x2019;s cyclical journey from lakes and rivers up to the clouds and down to earth again will further pique readers&#x2019; curiosity, along with the accompanying suggested reading list. VERDICT Pair this commendable companion to Sayre&#x2019;s Raindrops Roll with Jacqueline Briggs Martin&#x2019;s Snowflake Bentley as the seasons change and winter approaches. -- School Library Journal *STARRED*, <i>September 2016</i><br><br>A companion volume to Raindrops Roll (2015), this exceptionally handsome picture book offers a closeup&nbsp;look at snow.&nbsp;Crisp, concise phrases point out what happens before, during, and after a snowstorm,&nbsp;leading children from one&nbsp;idea to the next (freeze, cloud, snow, wind, sun, drips, slush) and ending with a&nbsp;sentence that echoes the beginning&nbsp;phrases. In the middle section, accompanying four large photos on two&nbsp;double-page spreads, these words&nbsp;relate to sunlight after a snowfall: &#x201c;Air warms. / Snow softens. / It drip, /&nbsp;drip, / drips. / Snowmelt / forms / icicle&nbsp;tips.&#x201d; Elements of the text are sometimes slanted, curved, or&nbsp;arranged in ways that underscore their&nbsp;meanings.&nbsp;While the lyrical narrative alone could be read in a&nbsp;minute, the variety, intricacy, and beauty of the&nbsp;photos give viewers many reasons to pause and look&nbsp;closely at each striking image. Sayre has a well-deserved&nbsp;reputation for exceptional nature photography&nbsp;and dependable science writing for young children. The appended &#x201c;Secrets of Snow&#x201d; section presents&nbsp;additional information related to observations made within the book.&nbsp;Combining eye-catching photos and a&nbsp;spare, poetic text, Sayre's latest informational picture book is uncommonly&nbsp;rewarding for one-on-one&nbsp;sharing and highly recommended for preschool and primary-grade units on snow.&nbsp;&#x2014; Carolyn Phelan -- Booklist, STARRED REVIEW, <i>September 15, 2016</i><br><br>Sayre follows&nbsp;<i>Raindrops Roll</i>&nbsp;with an attention-grabbing tribute to snow, pairing striking photographs with snowflake-delicate verse. Squirrels, deer, and other animals make cameos (&#x201c;A freeze. A breeze./ A cloud. It snows./ Snowflakes land/ on a squirrel&#x2019;s nose&#x201d;), but it&#x2019;s Sayre&#x2019;s images of feathery ice crystals, pine needles caked in dripping icicles, and riverscapes blanketed in white that capture the essence of winter&#x2019;s magic. An enlightening closing spread addresses a range of topics about snow (such as why snowflakes sometimes &#x201c;plaster one side of a tree branch but leave the other side bare&#x201d;), offering some scientific heft to balance the artistry and poetry of the preceding pages.

A popular media personality and keynote speaker, Mairlyn is the author of six award-winning cookbooks.<b>From &#x201c;Fibre 101, or How to Get an A+ on Your Colonoscopy&#x201d;<br></b><br> Years ago, one of my comedy buddies in my touring company at Second City was diagnosed with colon cancer. After he was finished treatment, a wild and crazy party was organized to celebrate. He spoke that night about the power of the colonoscopy and early detection and urged us to take part in a large study on colon cancer being held in Toronto. I wanted to be a part of the bigger picture and help science, so I immediately signed up. <br><br> Weeks later I was interviewed to become a volunteer in the study. I was so nervous&#x2014;I mean, what if I didn&#x2019;t pass? How pathetic would that be? What if the self-proclaimed Queen of Fibre got rejected for a study on poop, bowel function, and GI health? That would be an insult to my belief in the power of fibre. <br><br> Fortunately, or so I thought, I passed that test and was given a poop bucket to take home with me. The subway was really crowded that day; I had to stand holding the bar and a yellow poop bucket labelled &#x201c;Hazardous Waste.&#x201d; I knew people were staring, but I proudly clutched that bucket all the way home. I was helping science! I felt incredibly virtuous. The deal was, you pooped into the bucket and called a hotline, and a poop collector would come to your house within a specific time to ensure the poop was fresh, then rush it back to the lab. <br><br> Weeks later, after my colonoscopy prep (one of the most explosive preps known to man&#x2014;enough said!), I showed up at the hospital only to be told that I had arrived one week early. Despite my begging, cajoling, crying, guilt-tripping (&#x201c;I&#x2019;m participating in a colon cancer study for the betterment of mankind!&#x201d;), and, in one of the lowest-of-the-low moments of my life, throwing down the &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on TV&#x201d; card, the receptionist was a rock and wouldn&#x2019;t budge. <br><br> I was instructed to come back in several months so I could go through the whole shebang again. I quietly left the building, hat in hand, and did not submit myself to another colonoscopy prep until I was 50. Fortunately, this time I got the date right, had the colonoscopy, and received an A+. The doctor told me I had the most beautiful colon he&#x2019;d ever seen, and apparently, he&#x2019;d seen a million of them&#x2014;he seemed close to 100 years old. I&#x2019;ve considered having this carved on my tombstone: <br><br> <i>Here lies Mairlyn Smith:</i><br> <i>She had the most beautiful colon ever seen.</i><br> Signed, <i>The Unknown Centenarian Colon Doctor<br></i><br> You too can get an A+ on your colonoscopy by eating healthy, back-to-basic foods that include fibre-rich vegetables and fruits, berries, whole grains, nuts, seeds, pulses, and fermented foods, as well as going for a walk every day and drinking enough liquids to keep your GI tract happy and moving. It&#x2019;s never too late to start adding fibre-rich foods to your diet. This is the main reason I decided to write this cookbook. Although eating a lifetime of high-fibre foods is great, adding them to your eating style as of today is the best news your body will have heard in ages. Think of it as an investment in your retirement health savings plan. The sooner you start adding to it, the better. Your body is going to be on the winning end, pun intended.</p><h2>Think and Grow Thin: The Revolutionary Diet and Weight-loss System That Will Change Your Life in 88 Days!</h2><p><p>Millions across this nation have eaten themselves into a prison they can&#x2019;t escape &#x2013; and with Think and Grow Thin, Charles D&#x2019;Angelo busts down those walls and unlocks the secrets of weight-loss success.

Sproul<br><br><b>A cataclysmic change has occurred as our culture has shifted toward belief in "Oneism."</b><br><br>Every religion and philosophy fits into one of two basic worldviews: "Oneism" asserts that everything is essentially one, while "Twoism" affirms an irreducible distinction between creation and Creator. <i>The Other Worldview</i> exposes the pagan roots of Oneism, traces its spread throughout Western culture, and demonstrates its inability to save.<br><br>"For bodily holiness and transformed thinking . . . we depend entirely on one amazing thing: the incredibly powerful message of the Gospel to a sinful world, which is the ultimate expression and goal of Twoism. The only hope is in Christ alone."<br></p><p><b>Peter Jones</b> (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) is the author of many books, including <i>One or Two: Seeing a World of Difference</i>, <i>The God of Sex: How Spirituality Defines Your Sexuality, </i>and <i>The Gnostic Empire Strikes Back: An Old Heresy for the New Age</i>.<i> </i>He is the executive director of truthXchange and an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church in America.<b>This is a key book for understanding the profound worldview shift in all the West</b> (not just North America, but Latin America included). Peter Jones carefully analyzes its religious underpinnings and, in light of the Scriptures, demonstrates that there are only <i>two</i> choices. I highly recommend this work as the mature reflections of a scholar who has dedicated the last 20 years to this topic.<br>--<b>Rev. Bill Green, </b>Executive Secretary, <i>Confraternidad Latinoamericana de Iglesias Reformadas</i> (CLIR), Costa Rica<br><br>I have worked as a legal campaigner in Great Britain for two decades and witnessed the devastation of a politico-legal system that embraces Oneism and denies Twoism. <b>There is a suppression of Christianity in the public sphere, robbing our nation of what is good for all.</b> Peter Jones brilliantly explains how and why we are in such chaos, equipping us to speak and act relevantly in a culture steeped in old paganism.<br>--<b>Andrea Williams</b>, Chief Executive, Christian Concern and Christian Legal Centre, London, England<br><br>Dr. Peter Jones' new book is spot on! His historical, theological, and cultural analysis is of the highest caliber, <b>inspiring both great concern for the Church of the 21st century and great hope.</b> <i>The Other Worldview</i> is a must read for all Christian leaders who recognize and proclaim that God is the creator and we are his creation!<br>--<b>The Rt. Rev. Dr. Eric Vawter Menees</b>, Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin, Fresno, California<br><br>My good friend Peter Jones argues that the ills of modern culture stem from its denial of the biblical creator-creature distinction. Peter has made this case before, but <b>here he presents his most substantial, detailed, and illuminating account of this modern consciousness</b>, from ancient paganism and Gnosticism to such modern thinkers as Carl Jung. In the end Peter shows how the biblical gospel of salvation from sin in Christ provides the only adequate challenge to neo-pagan "Oneism," and the only way for us to know God as he really is.<br>--<b>Dr. John M. Frame</b>, J. D. Trimble Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, Florida<br><br>For over two decades, Peter Jones's work has proven indispensable for any Christian who wants to understand how to reach the pagan West with the gospel of Jesus Christ. In <i>The Other Worldview</i>, he helps readers see that there really are only two options available for how we view reality: Christianity and everything else. With the rare and enviable gift of being able to make complex ideas accessible, <b>Dr. Jones shows that the other worldview, in its varied expressions, cannot withstand intellectual scrutiny.</b><br>--<b>Rev. Dr. Gabriel N.E. Fluhrer</b>, Senior Minister, Shiloh Orthodox Presbyterian Church, Raleigh, North Carolina<br><br>The velocity and intensity of the cultural death spiral is overwhelming, yet its inevitable trajectory is affirmed in Scripture. In <i>The Other Worldview,</i> Peter Jones, with careful Biblical analysis, unfolds the inevitable embrace of paganism and its assured dissipation--<b>unless arrested by a God-exalting, Gospel proclamation of both common grace and redeeming grace displayed in word and deed.</b><br>--<b>Harry L. Reeder</b>, Senior Pastor, Briarwood Presbyterian Church, Birmingham, Alabama<br><br><b>The Christian faith's battles are sometimes described as "culture wars," but Peter Jones' new book shows them to be nothing less than a war of worldviews.</b> Peter is spot on when he identifies the <i>philosophia perennis</i> as underlying the seductive paganisms, ancient and modern, Eastern and Western. The monism and pantheism inherent in such views fail to distinguish between the Creator and the creature, the One and the many.<br><br>The Bible's worldview is quite distinct from the rest of the ancient East, and the contemporary West's entanglement with "Eastern spirituality" arises out of its rejection of the biblical paradigm. Atheistic secularism is under pressure from the innate human need for the spiritual--and this provides the opportunity for myriad spiritualities that justify any and every promiscuity under the guise of being "non-judgmental." Peter is absolutely right in his trenchant criticism of the desire to reconcile opposites and thus to obscure the difference between good and evil, right and wrong--even, perhaps especially, when this is done in the name of science.<br><br>Today, we need both a critique of the unexamined assumptions of Western culture and a competent apologetic for the Christian analysis of the human condition in a universe continually dependent on its Creator, who cannot simply be identified with it. We are in Peter's debt for providing such a critique and apologetic in this book.<br>--<b>Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali</b>, President of the Oxford Centre for Training, Research, Advocacy and Dialogue (OXTRAD), and formerly Bishop of Rochester, England<br><br><b>If the 21st century is looking more and more like the gnostic world of the first two centuries, we should be grateful that God has also provided another Irenaeus to go with it.</b> Peter Jones has for decades been a prophetic voice, and here he puts his wealth of wisdom and insight into something of a magnum opus, an <i>Against Heresies</i> for our time--although he would rightly insist on the singular, "heresy," instead of its plural. <i>The Other Worldview</i> is a must-read that brilliantly explains why.<br>--<b>Dr. Brian Mattson</b>, Senior Scholar of Public Theology, Center For Cultural Leadership, Coulterville, California</p><h2>DSM-5 Repositionable Page Markers</h2><p>Designed to help you quickly and easily locate key information within DSM-5 trademark this title includes markers that are made with a non-permanent adhesive and may be repositioned within your manual at any time It also includes four blank labels that may be customized according to your areas of interest</p><p><p>The DSM-5� Repositionable Page Markers are designed to help you quickly and easily locate key information within DSM-5�. </p><p>?

The spirit of oppression has specific telltale effects on individuals, communities, and nations. These are identified by Myles Munroe as a hatred for work, laziness, fear, low self-esteem, selfishness, lack of creativity, low initiative, and distrust of those in authority. To break free from these self-replicating cycles of oppression there must be a mental transformation. Paradoxically, freedom requires the need to impose control on self, require more responsibility than slavery, and the decision to accept a destiny of freedom, recognizing the process and discipline that personal and political freedom require. Simply put, The Burden Of Freedom should be available to every citizen and on the shelves of every high-school, college, and community library in the country. </p></p><p><p>Dr. Myles Munroe is a multigifted, international motivational speaker, author, educator, government consultant and businessman.

When fall arrives and&nbsp;the birds fly south, Fookwire is&nbsp;desolate.

In their third appearance, grumpy Old Man Fookwire is still painting pictures of his beloved birds and shaking his fist at squirrel shenanigans. But, instead of the baba, yaba, and floogle birds flying south alone, the squirrels tag along to see what all the fuss is about. When he receives a collect call from the squirrels turned beach bums, Fookwire's loneliness gets the better of him and he dusts off the red 1957 convertible he's kept hiding in a shed. After reuniting with his bird friends, sunburning his giant schnoz, and painting to his grumpy heart's content, he and the squirrels road trip it back together. Salmieri's characteristic sketches stretch every scene to humorous proportion, making the most of Rubin's quirky story line and eccentric vocabulary.

She lives in Seattle with her family.<b>Prologue</b><p>Lillian stood at the restaurant kitchen counter, considering the empty expanse in front of her. It was a Monday morning at the end of December and the restaurant held the calm that occurred only after the onslaught of holiday feasts, the culmination of a culinary season that began in the fall. In those months of ever shorter days, sometimes the only ingredients Lillian&#x2019;s customers could be bothered to take from their own kitchen cabinets were boxes of macaroni and cheese, bread for toast, and the restaurant provided both memory and inspiration&#x2014;golden half-globes of squash awash in butter, a lamb shank braised with the patience it would take to get through winter. After the exhilaration that was summer in the Pacific Northwest, autumn was like the sigh of an adolescent who realizes he must indeed grow up. It was Lillian&#x2019;s job to remind the people who sat at her tables that being an adult, the passing of a season or a year, was about more than just being older.</p><p>Still, Lillian thought, sometimes it was nice to be in the hush of an empty kitchen, without the heat of the ovens, the extra bodies of prep cooks and dishwashers and bussers and servers. This was what fed her&#x2014;this moment of stillness, the long, cool stretch of the counters and the give of the thick rubber mat beneath her feet.</p><p>She decided she&#x2019;d make a chowder, something simple and nourishing to take for her end-of-the-year appointment with Al, her accountant. Al wasn&#x2019;t quite old enough to be her father, but in many respects he had acted as one for her&#x2014;a steady hand and mind when she was first opening the restaurant and a dispenser of reliable advice in the eight years since. Their nonfinancial conversations revolved mainly around food; Lillian didn&#x2019;t know too much about Al&#x2019;s wife, and his silence regarding children led her to believe there were none. Al always seemed happiest when he was sitting at a table in the restaurant, or eating the lunches she brought to their appointments in his office. It was a small thing she could give him in return for all his insights, and she was glad to do it.</p><p>Lillian collected the salt pork and butter and heavy cream from the walk-in refrigerator, thyme from a pot on the windowsill, dried bay leaves from a glass jar in the row arranged along the wall. She turned on the heat under the pot and added the salt pork, which softened and began to brown. Her stomach grumbled; she remembered she hadn&#x2019;t eaten breakfast and cut a slice of bread, taking occasional bites as she sliced through the hard white flesh of the potatoes.</p><p>She removed the cracklings from the pot and added butter and chopped onion, the smells rising up&#x2014;onion never her favorite thing in the morning, but sometimes a chef didn&#x2019;t have a choice. She poured in chicken stock and then dropped in the potatoes, bringing the liquid to a boil and stepping away while they cooked. No point in pot-watching.</p><p>She returned to the walk-in refrigerator, using the intervening minutes to assess the food inside while her mind played with menus for the week. Leftover roasted red peppers and zucchini could be the beginnings of a pasta sauce; extra polenta could be sliced and fried in butter and sage. For all the glamour of restaurants, the underlying secret of the successful ones was their ability to magically repurpose ingredients, a culinary sleight of hand that kept them financially afloat and would have made any depression-era housewife proud.</p><p>Sensing the time, Lillian grabbed a package wrapped in butcher paper and headed back out to the prep area. The chunks of potatoes had softened. She smashed one against the side of the pot to thicken the broth, and then unwrapped the package.</p><p>As the white paper folded back, the smell of cod rose sinuously toward her, briny and green, the essence of old fishing nets and ocean waves. Nausea rolled up from Lillian&#x2019;s gut; she took one look at the fish and bolted for the back door.</p><p>Outside, she stood at the top of the stairs, gulping in the cold winter air.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; she said to herself. And then she stopped and looked down at her stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p><b>The Book of Rituals</b></p><br><p>When Al was a child, his mother was always showing him books with shapes in red and blue and yellow and green. Triangles. Squares. Circles, she said, pointing. But what he really liked were the shapes his mother called numbers&#x2014;the way the tall stick of a 1 seemed to be hiding its face from the elegant contours of the 2, the way the grandmotherly 3 nestled up to the stick-and-starch lines of the 4. Al&#x2019;s mother reminded him of a 7. If she had had bigger feet, she could have been a 2, he thought, but his mother always seemed to be floating a bit, or leaning&#x2014;against a countertop in the kitchen, the wall of the living room. Never quite sitting, never quite straight.</p><p>Over the weeks of Al&#x2019;s fourth summer, his mother taught him about counting, using ten straight sticks they collected from the backyard. Al paid attention dutifully, but he still thought that perhaps his mother had it all wrong. The straight sticks had their own purposes, but it was so much more fun to let your eyes slide up and around the slopes of a 9, the banister-curl of a 6. Even if you broke all the straight sticks up into tiny pieces, you could never recreate those curves.</p><p>The year Al turned five, his parents divorced and his mother relocated the two of them to Los Angeles. Compared with St. Louis, a land of thunderstorms that cracked the skies wide open and of snow that stopped the world into quiet, Los Angeles was almost overwhelming in its constancy, Monday passing the baton of hazy blue skies to Tuesday with unwavering tenacity. As Al&#x2019;s mother drove him around the city, checking out one apartment after another, Al began to believe that the buildings, the streets, the people, were like the weather, each one indistinguishable from the one before it, everything in shades of gray and beige.</p><p>It was like living in fog, Al thought as he stared out the car window. He remembered one night, not long before everything had fallen apart; he had snuck into the living room when his parents thought he was sleeping. They had been watching a movie where there was a lot of screaming and fog and a bad man who would come out of it and hurt people. But the heroine was smart; she found her way home by counting the doors along the street until she came to her own.</p><p>So Al began to count.</p><p>It was relaxing, he found. 6 buttons on his shirt and they were ready to go. 15 miles on the odometer, one clicking over to the next, and they were at their destination. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the destination looked no different from the other (9) apartments they had seen. The same (12) exterior steps from the first- to the second-floor units, the same (6) kitchen cabinet doors. Al couldn&#x2019;t figure out what his mother was looking for but one day they entered an apartment courtyard and his mother simply stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;This is it,&#x201d; she said. Al looked up at her. There were 3 sparkling stones at the corner of her glasses. A curl had come loose from the waves of her hair and dangled across her forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;OK&#x201d; he said. He liked that word. It was solid and simple and stood on its own 2 feet.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>Life in St. Louis had been leaf-drenched sycamore trees outside his bedroom window. A yard with grass that only got more and more green during the week, until Al&#x2019;s father went out on Sunday afternoon and the lawn mower roared into life, cutting the grass in long, straight rows, back and forth, back and forth, turning green into a smell that stayed on his father until he showered, an event that was always too far in the future for Al&#x2019;s mother and too soon for Al, who would follow his father around, breathing in the scent of sweat and gasoline and the moment when tall grass became short.</p><p>Los Angeles was a 2-room apartment with a nook of a kitchen. Al&#x2019;s mother slept on the foldout couch, and often Al did as well, for the bedroom, where she had carefully made the bed with his favorite sheets and painted the walls a friendly blue, still seemed too far away for him most nights. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea that there was nothing between his mother and the front door.</p><p>In this new city, Al&#x2019;s school was 3 blocks away. His mother would walk him in the morning, telling him he would have fun that day, although he wasn&#x2019;t sure either of them believed it. He would spend the morning with the other kids, drawing pictures of houses (which he didn&#x2019;t have) and families (ditto). Sometimes they played with puzzles whose pieces were made of numbers, and Al leaned into their familiarity with relief. More than once, his teacher had scolded him when she found the 7 hidden in his pocket. She told him the numbers belonged to all the children, but he didn&#x2019;t quite believe her. He could tell they cared only for the sound of the piece clicking into place. They didn&#x2019;t understand the way numbers could hold your life in their curves.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>One night in January, as Al&#x2019;s mother was tucking him into bed, she told him she had gotten a job.</p><p>&#x201c;The thing is,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s a special job and I need to be there in the evenings. But you&#x2019;re a big boy.&#x201d; She brushed his bangs back from his forehead. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be okay by yourself. I&#x2019;ll leave you dinner on a plate and then all you have to do is eat and put yourself to bed and when you wake up in the morning I&#x2019;ll be here.&#x201d;</p><p>Al wanted to tell his mother that he wouldn&#x2019;t be okay by himself&#x2014;that OK stood on its own 2 feet but all he wanted to do was curl up next to her on the couch. After his mother left that first evening, he stood in the middle of their apartment, listening carefully to the noises around him. He counted the cars and trucks driving by on the road until rush hour turned them into a stream too fast and thick for numbers, then he listened to steps walking along the corridor and the click of the lock as old Mrs. Cohen entered her apartment next door. It was quiet in Al&#x2019;s living room, the only sound the ticking of the baseboard heater that his mother said would eat his coat if he left it nearby.</p><p>The bad man in the movie always found people by their breathing. They would be hiding, in a shed or behind a door, and the bad man would hear the air racing in and out of their lungs and he would move forward, a smile slowly forming on his face. Al tried to stop breathing, but it didn&#x2019;t work&#x2014;and no matter all the other sounds of the world outside, you could still hear it.</p><p>Al looked around the living room and spotted the pink vacuum cleaner propped against the closet door. His mother hadn&#x2019;t even unplugged it in her hurry that day. Al knew he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to touch the machine, but he went over and flicked its switch and the roar blocked out everything else. He released the handle the way he&#x2019;d seen his mother do, and lined the machine up carefully, aiming straight at the other side of the room. Then he started pushing it in a straight row, back and forth across the green of the carpet.</p><p>After a while he heard a pounding on the door. He tried to ignore it, but it didn&#x2019;t stop and he finally turned off the vacuum cleaner.</p><p>&#x201c;That thing&#x2019;s been going for over an hour.&#x201d; Al recognized Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it too much to ask for a little peace?&#x201d; she continued.</p><p>Al stood, uncertain. His mother had said not to answer the door, but she didn&#x2019;t say anything about questions.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Al?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Al, I&#x2019;d like to talk with your mother.&#x201d;</p><p>This was not a question. Nor was it something that could happen.</p><p>&#x201c;Al? Are you there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is your mother there?&#x201d;</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>When Al&#x2019;s mother had come home that night to find her son sleeping on Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s big blue couch, there had been a discussion between the two women that Al was luckily too sound asleep to follow. But afterward Al started going to Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s apartment in the evenings while his mother was at work.</p><p>Al loved being at Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s. Her whole apartment was blue&#x2014;carpet, furniture, walls, each of them a slight variation in hue until Al felt as if he was underwater or in the sky, or both. She had a long hallway lined with family photographs, and every night she took Al on her &#x201c;memory walk&#x201d; as she called it, strolling down the length of the hall while she told him stories about each person. Al liked the small stories best, the ones about her children and husband&#x2014;the time Rachel put a frog in her mouth, the summer Eli decided he was Captain Hook and walked around for two weeks with his sleeve pulled down over his hand. How Mr. and Mrs. Cohen first met on a ship coming from Europe when he was fourteen and she was twelve; the way he had taught her to sway with the boat so she wouldn&#x2019;t get seasick. Mrs. Cohen would always shift her feet back and forth when she told that story, and Al would join her, feeling the boat beneath them.</p><p>Mrs. Cohen cooked, too&#x2014;beef stew that had simmered all day, pancakes that weren&#x2019;t pancakes but a combination of potatoes and onions and warmth that floated through the apartment and snuck into the pockets of his coat. And something she called a kugel, its name as playful as the smell of vanilla and sugar and cinnamon that came from the oven. But Al&#x2019;s favorite thing about being with Mrs. Cohen was Friday night. When he arrived, the apartment would be filled with fragrance of chicken soup and there was always fresh-baked bread, its surface brown and glistening, lying in a fancy braid across the counter. At dinnertime, she would light one candle and let Al light the other, and before they ate she sang an almost-song in a secret language just for them. Al didn&#x2019;t know what the words meant, but he loved how peaceful they felt, as if the phrases themselves were setting down the weight of the days behind them. Al looked forward to Friday all week long.</p><p>And then, one day when Al was ten, his mother told him they would be moving. He would have a new father, she said. They would live in a house again, wouldn&#x2019;t that be lovely? And it wasn&#x2019;t so far away. But the neighborhood they moved to was different than anything he had seen before&#x2014;cul-de-sacs lined with white and beige rectangles set low to the ground. No stairs to count, the windows uninterrupted sheets of glass. And worst of all, no Mrs. Cohen, because no matter how many times his mother said they weren&#x2019;t moving far, it was apparently too far to visit, and Fridays were date night for his mother and her new husband. Al would sit in his room with the door closed, trying to talk in Mrs. Cohen&#x2019;s secret language, while the babysitter cooked frozen TV dinners until the apple cobbler transformed into a fruit brick.</p><p>Al&#x2019;s math classes were the one place where the world made sense during the eight years that followed. Solve for x, the teacher would say, and Al could almost hear the numbers whispering in anticipation, ready to dive under the bar of a fraction, disappear down the trap door of a subtraction sign. It could make you feel almost sorry for the x, Al thought, with everybody staring at it, concentrating, their only goal to leave it standing alone.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>When Al went to college, he took classes in accounting. He could have studied mathematical theory; he had been tempted more than once by the silence of a 0, or the challenge of how to hold an i...</p></p><h2>Unhitching from the Crazy Train: Finding Rest in a World You Can&#39;t Control</h2><p>YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HOW LIFE SHOULD GO.

He was fired by his airline, stripped of his FAA licenses, tried, convicted, and sent to Federal prison. This was a first. It had never occurred before. Lyle Prouse came from a WWII housing project in Kansas and an alcoholic family where both parents died as a result of alcoholism. He rose through the ranks of the United States Marine Corps from private to captain, from an infantryman to a fighter pilot. He made his way to the pinnacle of commercial aviation, airline captain...then lost it all. Today he is a recovering alcoholic with nearly twenty-two years sobriety. This story describes his rise from the ashes of complete destruction from which he was never to fly again. It is full of miracles which defy all manner of odds. In a long and arduous journey, he eventually regained his FAA licenses. He never fought his termination; he considered it fair and appropriate. Miraculously, after nearly four years, the President/CEO of his airline personally reinstated him to full flight status in spite of all the adverse publicity and embarrassment. In effect, the President/CEO gambled his own career by taking such a risk on a convicted felon and publicly acknowledged alcoholic pilot. In another stunning event, the judge who tried, sentenced, and sent him to prison watched his journey and reappeared eight years after the trial. He became the driving force behind a Presidential pardon although he&#39;d never supported a petition for pardon in all his years on the bench. Lyle retired honorably as a 747 captain for the airline he&#39;d so horribly embarrassed and disgraced. He lives with his wife of nearly forty-nine years and has five grandchildren.

The bad news came on Christmas Eve, 2012. The prognosis from the oncologists was bleak. But Clifton decided to explore natural treatments. After all, there was nothing to lose. After sifting through tons of purported &#34;remedies&#34; and &#34;cures,&#34; he came upon information about something called &#34;paw paw.&#34; It was an extract from an American tree. To his surprise, this little-known treatment had been thoroughly studied and tested- for THIRTY YEARS! The success rate was amazing, and even more startling was that so few had ever heard of it. His wife started to take the paw paw capsules along with her standard (palliative) treatment. In less than a year she was cancer-free. Clifton wanted to scream - here was something remarkable, with a proven track record, and yet nobody seemed to know about it, and how it had extended - and even saved - so many lives. Instead of screaming, he wrote this book. He filled it with crucial information, case histories and scientific studies, dosage information, even included a chapter on veterinary use - and made it all understandable and readable. Paw paw is not a strong poison like chemotherapy drugs, but instead acts upon cancer cells to inhibit their ability to produce the energy they need to replicate. Paw paw even kills multiple drug resistant cells that chemo is powerless against. The volume is thoroughly documented and referenced, with a complete index. Clifton has also included natural remedies that complement paw paw, and tells the reader how to avoid unwanted side effects. Simply a &#34;must&#34; for anyone fighting cancer.</p><p><b>AMAZING . . .</b><br><br>It's just plain amazing. Yes, paw paw as a cancer treatment has an amazing track record. The evidence supporting the cancer-killing powers of this humble American tree is in itself "amazing."&nbsp; But that's not what I'm referring to. As I researched this book, what truly amazed me, <i>astounded</i> me, was the fact that paw paw is so little known. I couldn't believe that something so effective, so highly studied and proven was not a household word. <br><br>This stuff <i>kills </i>cancer cells -- most notably it kills the multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) cells that chemo cannot. When I discovered this fact I was totally blown away. Why didn't the whole world know about this? I wanted everyone to know how it helped bring my wife from&nbsp; "incurable" to "cancer-free" in a few short months.&nbsp; I felt like screaming.<br><br>Well, instead of screaming I decided to write this book. I did a year's research on it, and boiled all the information down to a concise, readable format, that anyone can understand and apply. <br><br>I do realize that with all the claims out there about natural cancer remedies, most people have more than a little skepticism about anything they never heard of claiming to be an effective cancer treatment. But here is something with so much science behind it, so few side effects (if any!), so many case histories of remarkable success, and so <i>inexpensive </i>that it just makes no sense for any cancer patient not to try it.<br><br>I want every cancer patient to read this book. It truly pains me to think that so many are currently fighting cancer with chemotherapy, radiation and surgery and don't know about paw paw -- their FOURTH CHOICE!</p><h2>Am I Dying?!: A Complete Guide to Your Symptoms--and What to Do Next</h2><p><p><strong>Featured on <em>CBS This Morning,</em> <em>Men&#x2019;s</em> <em>Health</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, Buzzfeed, and&nbsp;<em>The Dr. Oz Show</em></strong></p><p><strong>Two top doctors<em>&nbsp;</em>present a comprehensive, light-hearted guide for the hypochondriac in all of us.</strong></p><p>Christopher Kelly, MD, and Marc Eisenberg, MD, FACC, are both highly accomplished physicians and health experts from UNC Health and Columbia University Medical Center.

He was the founding minister of Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama and one of the founding fathers of Selma University.<p>We are in Walter Strickland's debt for publishing a new edition of Charles Boothe's <em>Plain Theology for Plain People</em>, an extraordinary book by an extraordinary man. This is everyday theology from the margins, from below, from the perspective of the dispossessed. It is no dry textbook, but theology written by an African-American pastor, born into slavery, who sought to instruct ordinary people in the Christian faith. A classic volume, short, readable, informative, by an inspiring Christian leader.</p> (Michael F. Bird, lecturer in theology, Ridley College 2017-07-18)<br><br><p>By reprinting...a book written for the average sharecropper, Walter R. Strickland has provided Christians with a helpful biblical and theological resource. Along with Strickland's insightful introduction, this book's reprinting provides another example (among many) of the contributions of black Christians to Christianity, their contributions to evangelical biblical and theological discourse, and their contributions to the intellectual environment of evangelical Christianity. Readers of Boothe's work will especially appreciate his intentional efforts to make the bible and theology accessible to his original audience.</p> (Jarvis J. Williams, associate professor of New Testament Interpretation at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary 2017-07-18)<br><br><p>Any given Sunday in some black churches, a member of the congregation may encourage the pastor by saying, "Make it plain, preacher!" In <em>Plain Theology for Plain People</em>, Charles Octavious Boothe makes plain a systematic theology that is both faithful to biblical orthodoxy and responsive to the particular interests of black Christians. I am thankful to God that Walter Strickland discovered this literary jewel and now shares it with the contemporary people of the Lord. Too often, the black church is mischaracterized as being emotionally rich and intellectually shallow. Plain Theology shows this to be a harmful stereotype. All disciples of Jesus Christ interested in how to, in the words of Robert Smith Jr., make doctrine dance should read this book and apply it to the preaching of the plain and pure gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> (CJ Rhodes, pastor of Mount Helm Baptist Church, Jackson, Mississippi 2017-07-18)</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Family Guide Italy (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b><b>A family-focused guidebook to Italy for traveling with children ages 4 to 12.</b></b><br><br>This guide offers you the best things to see and do on a family vacation throughout Italy, including Rome, Venice, and Florence.

It was a time when opulence among the city&#x2019;s newly minted rich and super-rich was flaunted with an unaccustomed boldness in the face of New York City&#x2019;s poor and homeless people, thousands of whom were packed into decrepit, drug-infested shelters, most of which were old hotels situated in the middle of Manhattan, some of which in decades past had been places of great elegance.<br><br>One of the largest shelters was the Martinique Hotel, across the street from Macy&#x2019;s and one block from Fifth Avenue. In this building, 1,400 children and about 400 of their parents struggled to prevail within a miserable warren of bleak and squalid rooms that offered some, at least, protection from the cold of winter, although many rooms in which I visited with families in the last week of December were so poorly heated that the children huddled beneath blankets in the middle of the day and some wore mittens when they slept.<br><br>I remember placing calls on freezing nights from phone booths on Sixth Avenue or Broadway trying to reach Steven Banks, a Legal Aid attorney who performed innumerable rescue actions for the families in the Martinique that year. The wind that cut across the open space of Herald Square at night was fierce, the sidewalks felt like slabs of ice, and kids and parents from the Martinique who had to venture out for milk or bread or medicines would bundle up as best they could in layers of old clothes and coats, if they did have coats, or sweatshirts with the hoods drawn tight around their chins.<br><br>Dozens of kids I knew within the building suffered from chronic colds. Many were also racked by asthma and bronchitis. Infants suffered from diarrhea. Sleepless parents suffered from depression. Mothers wept in front of me.<br><br>I had never seen destitution like this in America before. Twenty years earlier, I had taught young children in the black community of Boston and had organized slum tenants there and lived within their neighborhood and had been in many homes where rats cohabited with children in their bedrooms. But sickness, squalor, and immiseration on the scale I was observing now were virtually unknown to me.<br><br>Almost every child that I came to know that winter in the Martinique was hungry. On repeated evenings when I went to interview a family I gave up asking questions when a boy or girl would eye the denim shoulder bag I used to carry, in which I often had an apple or some cookies or a box of raisins, and would give them what I had. Sometimes I would ask if I could look into the small refrigerators that the hotel had reluctantly provided to the families. Now and then I&#x2019;d find a loaf of bread or several slices of bologna or a slice or two of pizza that had gone uneaten from the day before. Often there was nothing but a shriveled piece of fruit, a couple of jars of apple sauce, a tin of peanut butter, sometimes not even that.<br><br>I continued visiting the Martinique throughout the next two years. During that time, a play about impoverished children of the nineteenth century in Paris, called Les Miserables, opened to acclaim in the theater district of New York. Some of the more enterprising children in the Martinique would walk the twelve or fifteen blocks between the hotel and the theater district in late afternoons or evenings to panhandle in the streets around the theater or in front of restaurants nearby. Homeless women did this too, as well as many of the homeless men, some alcoholics and some mentally unwell, who slept in cardboard boxes on the sidewalks and in doorways of the buildings in the area.<br><br>The presence of these homeless people was not welcomed by the theater owners. People were paying a great deal of money to enjoy an entertainment fashioned from the misery of children of another era. The last thing that they wanted was to come out of the theater at the end and be obliged to see real children begging on the sidewalk right in front of them.<br><br>The problem was resolved to some degree when police and private guards employed by local businesses developed strategies for cleaning out the homeless--sanitation terms like &#x201c;cleaning out&#x201d; were used without embarrassment--from the streets around the theaters. Meanwhile, on the East Side of Manhattan, another group of business leaders went a little further by employing people in the homeless population to drive out other homeless people from Grand Central Station, where they had been taking refuge from the cold for several years by sleeping in the station&#x2019;s waiting rooms.<br><br>The ultimate solution, which required the removal of these homeless families from the midtown sections of Manhattan altogether, took a few more years to carry out successfully. In the interim, despite the efforts of the theater owners, many of the older children from the Martinique would manage to slip past the hired guards or the police and walk up to theater-goers, who would sometimes hand them a few dollars.<br><br>The younger children from the Martinique, however, did their begging for the most part close to home within the blocks surrounding the hotel, where they would run into the streets when drivers slowed their cars as the lights were changing and where a driver whose compassion overcame his irritation might roll down his window far enough to give the kids some money. Those who were inclined to castigate the parents of these children for letting them go out into the streets at night might have relented somewhat if they understood how rapidly the competence of many of these parents had come to be eroded by the harshness of conditions in that building.<br><br>Scenarios of broken will and loss of good decision-making skills were apparent everywhere. Some of the parents were emotionally ill when they arrived here; but those who weren&#x2019;t would frequently succumb to the pervasive atmosphere of insecurity and high anxiety that suffused the filthy corridors and crowded living spaces of the Martinique. Many who had not used drugs before this time became drug users in a setting in which heroin and crack cocaine were readily available. (The sixteenth floor of the Martinique Hotel--there were seventeen floors in all, but the top two were unoccupied--was operated, with the knowledge and, apparently, cooperation of some of the guards, as an open market for drug users.) A number of people became HIV-infected under these conditions, although in 1985 the term was not yet widely recognized among some of the residents and many did not understand exactly why it was that they were growing ill.<br><br>The conditions under which these people had to live were not unknown to New York City&#x2019;s social service system or to its political administration. Anybody who was able to get past the guards, as I did repeatedly with the cooperation of two sympathetic social workers who enabled me to get into the upper floors and visit families pretty much at will, could not avoid, unless he closed his eyes, the sight of overflowing garbage piled in the landings and of children who, for lack of other options, played amidst that garbage.<br><br>But physical unhealthiness, the prevalence of drug addiction, and the documented presence of widely known carcinogens (open containers of asbestos, for example, and asbestos-coated pipes in the lobby of the building) were not the worst of the destructive forces children and their families had to undergo. The Martinique, as I was forced to recognize when the social workers started talking candidly to me during the months to come, was not merely a despairing place, diseased and dangerous for those who had no choice but to remain there; it also was a place of flagrant and straightforward criminality on the part of management and ownership. A young man with a raw, salacious smile, to whom the social workers made it a special point to introduce me and who, they told me, was a relative of one of the two owners of the building, used the power he was thus afforded to induce young women to provide him with erotic favors in exchange for items that they needed, such as cribs and linens for their children.<br><br>&#x201c;He boasts about it,&#x201d; one of the two social workers told me. &#x201c;He describes it to us openly, and gleefully. He goes into considerable detail. . . .&#x201d; Some of the guards, the social worker said, took advantage of the younger mothers too, as one of those mothers, a smart and savvy woman who told me she had had to fight off their advances, reported to me at the time and has repeated since.<br><br>There was no need for secrecy, it seemed, because there was a sense that this was &#x201c;a closed system,&#x201d; where rules of normal law and normal governance did not apply. Complaint or protest would have no effect except to prompt the guards or manager to punish the complaining woman by denying her essential services or else, if the manager so wished, by calling the police and charging her with one of many forms of misbehavior that were common in a building in which almost every person had to break some rule or operate some petty scam in order to survive.<br><br>Cooking, for example, was officially prohibited because of fire dangers, but the city&#x2019;s meager allocation of subsistence funds to purchase food made it unthinkable to buy it from a restaurant and forced the mothers in the Martinique to cook their children&#x2019;s meals in secret, then conceal their hot plates when inspectors from the city came around. The management cooperated with the tenants by providing them with garbage bags to cover up the hot plates on inspection days while, at the same time, it pretended not to know that this was going on. When mothers were reluctant to provide the guards who were hired to protect them with the favors they expected, the guards could use the cooking scam or other scams much like it as a way to break down their resistance.<br><br>Children, of course, observed the humiliation of their mothers. The little ones, too young to go to school, might perhaps be sent out to the corridors; but most of the mothers would not dare to let them wander too far from the bedroom door. Even the kids who never witnessed these activities first-hand could not fail to be aware of them. I used to wonder what enduring influence all of this would have upon the capability of children in the building to believe in any kind of elemental decency in people who have power over their existence. Would they later find it hard to trust the teachers in their public schools? Would they develop an endemic wariness about investing faith in any older person of authority? Would they love their mothers all the more for having done the best they could to protect them from this nightmare, or would they harbor a resentment that their mothers were not able to avoid this situation in the first place?<br><br>One of the social workers who befriended me that year, a sensitive man who had studied early childhood development as an undergraduate at Yale, spoke of the Martinique in unsparing language as &#x201c;New York City&#x2019;s midtown death camp for the spirits of poor children.&#x201d; He knew that I was Jewish and he asked me later if this choice of language had offended me. I told him it did not. I thought it was justified.<br><br>Two years later, I published a book about the Martinique Hotel. It appeared first in two successive issues of The New Yorker magazine, and this, in turn, attracted interest from the other media. The Nightline television program, moderated at the time by the journalist Ted Koppel, asked me to go back into the Martinique with a camera crew and do a documentary on the families I had known. The social workers and some of the mothers helped to get the camera crew and the producer past the guards and up into the building. The camera itself was hidden in a baby carriage by one of the mothers, who rolled it through the lobby without attracting scrutiny and brought it with her on an elevator to the floor where she was living. She then accompanied us into other bedrooms whose occupants had told me they were not afraid to answer questions.<br><br>By the time we had finished with the final interview, however, a guard on an upper floor had become suspicious, banged at the door, which we did not open, then notified the management. The manager, an unpleasant character by the name of Sal Tuccelli who carried a pistol in an ankle holster, confronted us with several other guards and insisted that the cameramen hand over the material they had just recorded. When they refused, the manager and guards reacted in the same way they routinely did with residents who defied or disobeyed them. I was slammed against a metal wall. One of the cameramen was seriously injured. The TV producer, an unintimidated woman, removed one of her high-heel shoes and used it to defend us. By this point, the police had been alerted. The cameramen got out of the building with the video.<br><br>I knew, of course, that journalists were not welcome in the building and that the social workers who had made my visits possible were taking risks in doing so. But until this time I had never witnessed so directly the extremes to which the management would go in the interest of concealment. It reminded me more vividly than ever that the city and the owners of the Martinique, with whom the city had contracted to sequester homeless people at a price tag of $8 million yearly for those 400 families, were determined to discourage any troublesome exposure of the social crime in which they were colluding.<br><br>It also left me with a visceral reminder of the terror mothers and their children would experience when the guards or, more frequently, the manager would hammer at their doors early in the morning if, for example, the rental check paid by the city, through no fault of their own, had not arrived on time. &#x201c;Six a.m.,&#x201d; one of the mothers told me. &#x201c;He bangs on the door. You open up. There he is in the hallway with his gun. &#x2018;Where&#x2019;s your rent?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>This is the way that one of the richest cities in the world treated the most vulnerable children in its midst a quarter century ago. When these hotels were finally closed in 1988 and 1989, not for reasons of compassion but because of the enormous damage the visibility of so much desperation was doing to the image of the city and its elected leaders, most of the several dozen families I had come to know, all but two of whom were black or Latino, were shipped en masse into several of the most impoverished and profoundly segregated sections of the Bronx, far from the sight of tourists and the media. These were communities that already had the city&#x2019;s highest rates of HIV infection, the greatest concentration of drug-addicted people, of people who had serious psychiatric illnesses, women with diabetes, women with undiagnosed malignancies, and among the highest rates of pediatric asthma in the nation.</p><h2>Murach&#39;s Oracle SQL and PL/SQL for Developers, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>If you're developing applications that access Oracle databases, you can save time and work by having SQL do more of the data handling for you: This new book shows you how. It teaches you how to create effective SQL queries to extract and update the data in an Oracle database. It teaches you how to design and implement a database, giving you insight into performance and security issues. It teaches you how to use PL/SQL to take advantage of powerful features like stored procedures, functions, and triggers. In short, it teaches you to create the kind of efficient database applications that make you a more effective and valuable developer.</p><p></p><p><b>Here are 5 of the ways that our book differs from the others</b></p><p></p><p><b>#1: You'll see how to take advantage of the Oracle SQL Developer tool</b></p><p>SQL Developer is a free tool for working with database objects and SQL statements. Its graphical interface makes it more intuitive and easier to use than older command-line tools like SQL*Plus. I think you'll find it boosts your productivity as you use it to write and run queries, to work with database objects, or to debug stored procedures.</p><p><b>#2: You'll start off with how to query a database, not how to design one</b></p><p>This book is written for application developers, and the first thing an application developer needs to know is how to write queries. So that's what's covered in the first 8 chapters of this book. It starts with simple queries, then moves on to complex inner and outer joins, summary queries, and subqueries that do more of the database processing so that your applications can do less.</p><p>Once you're comfortable with querying databases, this book shows how to design a database and how to create database tables. Having this background can help you query a database more effectively. And it provides a solid introduction to DBA skills if you're interested in that career path.</p><p><b>#3: You get 2 books in 1: A SQL book and a PL/SQL book</b></p><p>PL/SQL allows you to write complex scripts, stored procedures, functions, and triggers, all essential skills for most application developers. So along with SQL, this book covers the PL/SQL that you'll use most of the time; there's no need to buy a second book to learn PL/SQL.</p><p><b>#4: Complete applications show you how all the pieces interact</b></p><p>One key to mastering SQL is to have plenty of coding examples that show how the features you re learning work and what problems you may run into as you use them on your own. So this book provides dozens of SQL statements and PL/SQL scripts for various jobs that are routine in business applications. Download the examples for free from our website and use them as starting points for your own SQL routines.</p><p><b>#5: The paired-pages format lets you set your own pace</b></p><p>Depending on what you already know about Oracle SQL and how fast you want to go, you can read every page and study each example...skim through the headings for topics you don't know...scan through the righthand pages for development details you might have missed in the past...or turn to any two-page spread when you need reference information. The paired-pages format makes it easy and fast for you to use the book the way you want to.</p><p>(If you aren't familiar with how the paired pages work, please be sure to download a sample chapter from our website)</p></p><p>Joel Murach has been writing and editing books about computer programming for over 10 years.

It honors the disciplines we teach by reminding us of their inherent meaning, rather than allowing us to accept them as collections of data. It honors teachers with the belief that they grow as human beings through understanding the power of what they teach and crafting approaches for sharing that power with young learners. It honors students by expecting them to become thinkers capable of reasoned stewardship of the world they live in and will inherit. It maps out a path for achieving the twin goals of content understanding and developing thinking&#x2015;both too long absent in too many schools."</em> Author: Carol Ann Tomlinson, Ed.D., William Clay Parrish, Jr. Professor<br><br><em>"This revised edition is essential for all educators!

It was an act that forced the permanent evacuation of a city, killed thousands and crippled the Soviet Union. The event spawned decades of conflicting, exaggerated and inaccurate stories. This book, the result of five years of research, presents an accessible but comprehensive account of what really happened. From the desperate fight to prevent a burning reactor core from irradiating eastern Europe, to the self-sacrifice of the heroic men who entered fields of radiation so strong that machines wouldn&#x2019;t work, to the surprising truth about the legendary &#x2018;Chernobyl divers&#x2019;, all the way through to the USSR&#x2019;s final show-trial. The historical narrative is interwoven with a story of the author&#x2019;s own spontaneous journey to Ukraine&#x2019;s still-abandoned city of Pripyat and the wider Chernobyl Zone. Complete with over 45 pages of photographs of modern-day Pripyat and technical diagrams of the power station, Chernobyl 01:23:40 is a fascinating new account of the world&#x2019;s worst nuclear disaster.

Ritland started his own company training and supplying dogs for the SEAL teams, U.S. Government, and Department of Defense. He knew that fewer than 1 percent of all working dogs had what it takes to contribute to the success of our nation's elite combat units, and began searching the globe for animals who fit this specific profile. These specialized canines had to pass rigorous selection tests before their serious training could begin.</p><p>The results were a revelation: highly trained working dogs capable of handling both detection and apprehension work in the most extreme environments and the tensest of battlefield conditions. Though fiercely aggressive and athletic, these dogs develop a close bond with the handlers they work side by side with and the other team members. Truly integrating themselves into their units, these K9 warriors are much like their human counterparts&#x2015;unwavering in their devotion to duty, strong enough and tough enough to take it to the enemy through pain, injury, or fear.</p><p>For the first time ever, <i>Trident K9 Warriors</i> gives readers an inside look at these elite canines&#x2015;who they are, how they are trained, and the extreme missions they undertake saving countless lives, asking for little in the way of reward. From detecting explosives to eliminating the bad guys, these powerful dogs are also some of the smartest and most highly skilled working animals on the planet.</p></p><p><p>MIKE RITLAND joined the Navy in 1996 and graduated with BUD/S class 215. After years as a member of SEAL Team 3, he became a BUD/S instructor and then started his own company to train dogs for the SEAL teams. Today he continues to supply working and protection dogs to a host of clients, including the U.S. government and Department of Defense. He also started the Warrior Dog Foundation to help retired Special Operations dogs live long and happy lives after their service.</p><p>GARY BROZEK has coauthored and ghostwritten nearly twenty books, four of which have become <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He lives with his wife and their dog, Huckleberry, in the mountains outside of Denver.</p><p>&#x201c;After a stellar career in the Teams, Mike Ritland has gone on to train working K9's for some of the most elite units in the U.S. Special Operations community. These dogs are integrated into Special Operations at all levels of mission planning. They HALO parachute from high altitude, chase enemy squirters, and detect explosive booby traps, to name just a few tasks. If you want to learn about these amazing animals, the sacrifices they've made, and their effectiveness in combat, then read <i>Trident K9 Warriors</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Brandon Webb, former Navy SEAL, New York Times bestselling author of The Red Circle, and editor in chief of SOFREP.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Ritland] and co-writer Gary Brozek tell a rattling good story, detailing the checkered history of dogs in combat and the contributions their making today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cesar's Way</i></p><p>&#x201c;The accounts of fieldwork and battles are specific and extraordinary, making this a pick for any military collection.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Internet Bookwatch</i></p></p><h2>Locomotives: The Modern Diesel and Electric Reference</h2><p><p> <i>"This new oversize, full color book is the 'Diesel Spotter's Guide' on steroids. ...

It covers all mainline locomotive models built for North American railroads from the mid-1970s onward. This revised and expanded edition includes data on all the new locomotive models built from 2007 to January 2015, including the latest electrics from Siemens and Tier 4 locomotives from General Electrics. </p><p> Containing 32 new pages, and over 300 photographs of more than 120 models, this remarkable large-format reference covers every locomotive manufacturer. Greg McDonnell provides concise yet comprehensive information on each model, along with easy-to-read tables of production totals, build dates and mechanical specifications. </p></p><p><p> Greg McDonnell is the author of 10 books on a wide range of transportation subjects and a professional photojournalist for railroad publications in the United States and Canada. He received the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society's Fred A. and Jane R. Stindt Photography Award for significant contribution to the photographic interpretation of North America's railroading history. He lives in Cambridge, Ontario. </p><p> Jerry A. Pinkepank is the author of the original <i>Diesel Spotter's Guide</i> and founder of the diesel locomotive news magazine <i>Extra 2200 South</i>. He lives in Seattle, Washington. </p><p>INTRODUCTION<br> WHAT ARE THESE DIESELS? </p><p> The headline appeared on a full-page ad in the February 1967 issue of Trains magazine and with it, a photograph and a promise. The photo was a Don Wood image of Pennsylvania Railroad Alcos, Baldwins, EMDs and FMs of every imaginable shape and size crowding the shop tracks in Altoona, Pa. The promise? "Just a glance through the all-new <i>Diesel Spotter's Guide</i> and you'll know their makers, model numbers, wheel arrangements, and horsepower." The first all-encompassing guide to North American diesels, Jerry A. Pinkepank's 304-page manual was, for diesel fans, just what the doctor ordered. </p><p> For a kid in school, filling the prescription was another matter. Money was always in short supply, and there were Beatle albums to buy and 45s and film and <i>Trains</i> magazine. It was a big day when the package marked with a Kalmbach "K" and a 1027 North 7th Street return address arrived in the mail. Pinkepank made good on the publisher's promise. In the pulp pages behind a glossy color cover adorned with the faces of SOO GP35 722, L and N C420 1306 and Santa Fe U28CG 358, the <i>Diesel Spotter's Guide</i> told all, from the oft-disputed difference between a GP7 and a GP9 to a detailed description of the Alco Blunt truck, to spotting details and production totals for everything from the Baldwin AS16 to the GE U50. It was the best three dollars and fifty cents I ever spent. </p><p> Forty years and half a dozen editions of the <i>Spotter's Guide</i> later, locomotives and railroading have changed immeasurably. The three units that graced the cover of the original DSG have long ago been scrapped, and the railroads that owned them have been swallowed up in mergers; GE, still considered a newcomer in the road-diesel trade when the first <i>Diesel Spotter's Guide</i> hit the stands, has been the number one locomotive builder in North America for more than 20 years ... and three dollars and fifty cents will buy a good cup of coffee. </p><p> Railroading, nevertheless, remains as exciting as ever, and the fascination of locomotives is undiminished by the consolidation of the continent's major railroads into a handful of supersystems. Through it all, Kalmbach and authors Jerry A. Pinkepank and Louis A. Marre maintained the standard established in 1967 with continuously updated versions of the diesel reference book known to generations of locomotive fans as simply "the <i>DSG</i>." This book aims to uphold the standard and honor the tradition of the <i>Diesel Spotter's Guide</i>. </p><p> This book picks up new locomotive production where Louis Marre's <i>Diesel Locomotives: The First 50 Years</i> (Kalmbach 1995) leaves off and updates the information first published in <i>The Field Guide to Modern Diesel Locomotives</i> (Kalmbach 2002). However, its starting point is not a single date. Electro-Motive coverage begins with the 1972 introduction of the Dash 2 series and all models cataloged at that time. This includes the SW1000, SW1001 and SW1500, switcher models that predate the Dash 2 but remained in production beyond 1972. General Electric coverage begins with the Dash 7 series, introduced in 1977. Wabtec's MotivePower Inc., along with its Morrison Knudsen/MK Rail/Boise Locomotive group predecessors, which began building locomotives at Boise, Idaho, in 1991, is also included, along with Alstom's Hornell, N.Y.-built PL42s, RailPower's hybrid Green Goats and the latest genset switchers from National Railway Equipment Co., RailPower Technologies Corp., MotivePower Inc., as well as locomotives from Brookville Equipment and ACS64 electrics from Seimens. </p><p> The scope of this volume has been broadened to include electric passenger locomotives currently in service on the Northeast Corridor. The limited number of electric freight locomotives, none of which are presently in common carrier service in North America, are not included. Electric locomotives built between 1972 and December 31, 1988, are included in Marre and Pinkepank's <i>Contemporary Diesel Spotter's Guide</i> (Kalmbach 1989). </p><p> Although the production of MLW-Bombardier falls within the chronological coverage of this volume, the fact that none of the company's locomotives remain in service on Class 1 railroads (in fact, very few remain in service in North America at all) precludes inclusion here. Pre-1977 GE U-series "U-boat" models are excluded for the same reason. Although a small number of U-series GEs do survive in the employ of short lines, the last U-boat in service on a Class 1 railroad, CSXT U23B 3305, was retired in 2000. All of these models are, however, included in Marre's <i>Diesel Locomotives: The First 50 Years</i>. </p><p> Industrial locomotives and rebuilds are outside the realm of this book. However, a few exceptions have been made: EMD BL20-2s, GE Super 7 locomotives and several Morrison Knudsen/Boise Locomotive models constructed using the frame and some remanufactured components from retired locomotives are included here. While convention dictates that a locomotive is defined by its frame, the aforementioned models are essentially new locomotives constructed on a recycled platform. By the same premise, Green Goats and genset locomotives built on reconditioned frames are likewise included. From a trackside perspective, they fall quite squarely within the mandate of this book and its goal to help answer that perennial question: What are these diesels ... and electrics? </p></p><h2>The Manchurian Candidate</h2><p><p><b>'Brilliant...wild and exhilarating' <i>New Yorker</i></b></p><p>Sgt Raymond Shaw is a hero of the first order.

This volume presents excellent biblical scholarship in a format accessible to laypeople with no special training in biblical studies.</p><p>"Any observer of contemporary culture will recognize that Anderson's and Keating's lucid commentaries arrive at just the right time, when Catholics at the parish level and in undergraduate and seminary coursework desperately need resources that acquaint them with the scriptural text, the broader scriptural context, and the ways in which scriptural passages have been understood and lived within the Church's rich tradition. Well instructed in contemporary scholarship, Anderson and Keating put us all in their debt by focusing firmly on the heart of the matter--namely, learning from the letters of James and John how to live and love as Christians in a fallen world."<br>--<b>Matthew Levering</b>, Mundelein Seminary<br><br>"In their volume on the Letter of James and the Letters of John, Anderson and Keating have succeeded admirably in advancing the aims that the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture series has set for itself. The exposition of the inspired text is clear and easily accessible, rich in making connections with the rest of the Bible and the other sources of revelation, and always focused on sharing the saving message the Lord has for his people--all done with scholarly excellence.

This time Reuben Prien at the secret, government-sponsored Project wants Si to leave his home in the 1880s and visit New York in 1912. Si's mission: to protect a man who is traveling across the Atlantic with vital documents that could avert World War I. So one fateful day in 1912, Si finds himself aboard the world's most famous ship...the <i>Titanic.</i></p><p>Jack Finney (1911&#x2013;1995) was the author of the much-loved and critically acclaimed novel <i>Time and Again</i>, as well as its sequel, <i>From Time to Time.</i> Best known for his thrillers and science fiction, a number of his books&#x2014;including <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers&#x2014;</i>have been made into movies.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>We stood bunched in with the little crowd you can see on the balcony down there at the right -- see it? -- just over the pillared entrance to the Everett House: Julia and I, her hands in her muff; and our four-year-old son, chin on the balcony rail. When I leaned over him to see his face in the light of the marching torches below us, his expression was fixed in wonder. I was here on assignment, but this was also a part of nineteenth-century life, a great parade, that I liked a lot. We had no movies, radio, or television, but we did have parades, and often. Now every possible inch of standing room down there in Union Square was lost under the packed-together shoulders and the tops of derbies, tall hats, fur caps, shawled hair, and bonnets. Winding around the roadway through that thick crowd, hundreds of marching men, and floats, flags, bands, horses, all fitfully visible in the bobbing firelight from rank after rank of gimballed canisters of smoky flame.<br><br>The sound was a thrill: the splendid brass blare of marching bands and the yells of the crowd. What they yelled, I'd noticed again and again, was "Hurrah!" -- actually pronounced <i>hurrah.</i> We stood hearing fireworks whistle up, watched them burst gorgeously against the black sky with that muffled fireworks <i>pop.</i> Skyrockets shot through these bursts and curved off, dying. Where did they land? And paper balloons, their swinging baskets of orange fire shining through the sides. Every now and then flame crawled up a paper panel, and the balloon would drop, blazing. Where? Were there men waiting on the dark rooftops around the square with buckets of water? Must have been, must have been.<br><br>It was glorious, all black dark and flowering color, marching leather shuffling on cobbles, drums banging, cymbals smashing. Only a political parade, the election weeks ahead, but fun. Another band moving past now, this one in tall flat-topped shakos with plumes and tiny peaks, the snares rattling, lots of powerful horn and trumpet and that bell-like thing that tops it all off. Splendid blaring sound, very close, and once again that night I felt the actual chill right up the spine, and the slightly embarrassing eye sting, of easy emotion about nothing.<br><br>Now a turnverein band in funny costumes, and we stayed for that -- Willy insisted. Then we left to beat the crowd, coming down through the hotel. I liked the hotel because someone had told me that a couple of the old men sitting around the lobby were veterans of the War of 1812, but there were none there tonight. I didn't believe it anyway. Out the side entrance of the hotel, and across the street, around the square, the curbs were solid with waiting carriages, their lamps lighted, an occasional iron horseshoe stomping the stone. Just as we approached him a horse began urinating, fascinating Willy, who wanted to stop and watch, Julia's arm under mine tugging us past, me grinning. A few carriages further on we stopped to lift Willy to pat the soft nose of a more genteel horse, something he loved.<br><br>Then we walked home, the streets near to silent except for an occasional passerby or clip-clopping carriage. It was nice out, not too cold. There'd been a moon earlier, but I couldn't find it now. Plenty of stars though, the sky a great enclosing blackness over this low city; millions of stars, those near the horizon spiky and glittery.<br><br>Willy was asleep, head sweetly heavy on my shoulder when we reached the little square of greenery which was Gramercy Park, turning to walk partly around it. We rented a house here, a three-story brownstone with basement and attic, across the park from Julia's aunt. Julia liked being near her aunt, and so did I. I liked Aunt Ada, and it gave us a convenient and willing babysitter. We passed a carriage, horse tethered to the hitching post, carriage lamps shining orangely, and I wondered about it. Then, as we passed I heard a door, turned and saw light from the Bostwick entrance hall shining out on the steps, a man leaving, putting on his derby as he came down, and I saw the little satchel in his hand: a doctor. I said, "Old Mr. Bostwick must be sick," and Julia said that in the park with Willy yesterday, she'd been told by another mother that he was. Old Mr. Bostwick interested me because I knew he'd been born in 1799, the year Washington died -- were they contemporaries for a few months or weeks?<br><br>My name is Simon Morley, I'm "thirtyish," as we say, and although I was born well into the twentieth century, I live back here in the nineteenth, married to a young woman born long before I was or even my parents. Because -- according to Dr. E. E. Danziger, retired professor of physics from Harvard -- time is like a river. It carries us forward through its bends, into the future...but the past remains in the bends behind us. If so, said Dr. D, we ought to be able to reach it. And got himself a government grant to try.<br><br>We are tied to the present, Dr. Danziger said, by countless threads -- the countless things that <i>make</i> the present: automobiles, television, planes, the way Coca-Cola tastes. An endless list of tiny threads that tie us to <i>now.</i><br><br>Well, study the past, he said, for the same kind of mundane details. Read its newspapers, magazines, and books. Dress and live in its style, think its thoughts -- all the things that make it <i>then.</i> Now find a place that exists in both times unchanged; "Gateways," he called them. And live in that place which also exists in the time you want to reach -- dressing, eating, and thinking the way they did -- and presently the ties holding you to the present will relax. Then blank out even the knowledge of these ties through self-hypnosis. And let your knowledge of the time you want to reach come flooding up in your mind. And there -- in a Gateway existing in both times -- you may, you just may make the transition.<br><br>Most people failed, at the Project where we were trained. They'd try and -- just couldn't. But I could, one of the very few. Made it back into the nineteenth century, returned to make my report, then went back to stay -- to marry Julia, and live out my life in the nineteenth century.<br><br>Now at our house, in familiar routine, Julia stepped on ahead up the stairs to unlock and open the front door for me; and in the hall she turned up the light. Then I passed Willy over to her because our dog -- a fairly big woolly black dog with dabs of white here and there -- was doing his little dance around my feet, trying to trip me for laughs. I let him out, and sat waiting on the front stoop while he wandered around, sniffing, checking to see that nothing had been changed out here. He's a fine fellow, called Rover, a fairly common name that hadn't yet become funny. Big black dogs, I'm afraid, are often Nig.<br><br>Rover came back to sit down beside me, and I gave him his ear rub, which he accepted graciously, tongue lolling to show appreciation. I had various little routines with Rover, adding to and improving them from time to time, but it was best, I'd learned, to keep them out here. Julia is bright, quick-minded, and as subtle and perceptive as anyone. Yet one evening when old Rove came wandering in to join us in the sitting room, with a long thread of drool hanging from his black lips, I suggested to Julia that he might be an enchanted prince and that she ought to give him a big wet kiss to release him from his spell. But all I got for that was trouble, because her sense of humor, naturally, is pure nineteenth-century. One evening fairly early in our marriage we sat reading in bed, and she laughed aloud and pointed to what she'd just read in her newspaper. I leaned over and read it; it was a joke, a filler at the bottom of a column. The little onmibuses on Broadway and on Fifth Avenue are called stages by some, others call them buses, and the joke was: "'Don't you think I have a good face for the stage?' asked a lady with histrionic aspirations. 'I don't know about the stage,' replied her gallant companion, 'but you have a lovely face for a buss.' " I imitated a chuckle, nodding my head very rapidly to suggest appreciation. As I once did at a Harrigan and Hart performance which was truly terrible, dreadful "faith and begorra" Irishman jokes. But Julia actually cried from laughter, along with everyone else but me. I faked it.<br><br>"I understand you're Man's Best Friend," I said to Rover now, there on the front stoop, and he agreed. ("Man's Best Friend" was serious business here, a subject for sentimental newspaper poetry, which Julia no longer read aloud to me.) "But it seems to me," I told Rover, who sat listening politely as though he'd never heard this before, "that it's kind of a one-sided friendship. We do all the work. We get your dinners" -- his ears lifted at the magic word -- "get your water, provide beds, fireplaces, baths" -- the ears flattened -- "all the necessities, nay, luxuries of the carefree dog's life." I began leaning close to him. "But what do you do in return, Best Friend?" I leaned still closer. "Where are my slippers?" He didn't know, but now he could, and did, as I'd expected, give me a wet tongue up the side of my face. "That's the <i>deal?"</i> I said. "Dog spit all over the face? Listen" -- I grabbed him around the shoulders, hugging him close while he tried to pull his head loose, but I had him. "Where did you guys ever get this idea that a face lacquered with dog spit is some kind of favor? Thousands of years, but you never learn." I let him go, and he sat paying attention to whatever I might want to say. Dogs try to understand, they <i>want</i> to; cats never do. I gave Rove a friendly tail yank; then he followed me in, and out to his back-porch bed.<br><br>Up in our big bedroom Julia and I moved around, getting ready for bed, not saying much, still under the spell of a good evening. I liked this room, liked them all, but this especially: carpeted; gaslit; furnished with what I was aware were almost ridiculously massive, overornamented tables, chiffoniers, two big wardrobes, a leather chair, our big bed. But a place I loved: peaceful, a refuge.<br><br>Above my right shoulder -- we were in bed now, sitting up to talk for a few moments the way we usually did -- an open-flame light burned steady behind an etched and frosted shade. On the small marble-topped table beside me lay a copy of the new January 11, 1887, issue of <i>Leslie's Weekly.</i> I had two drawings in it this week, and I liked looking at them; so did Julia, who saved them all. My watch and chain, the watch tick-ticking pleasantly -- I had just wound it -- lay on the <i>Leslie's.</i> From below, outside at street level and approaching our slightly opened window, footsteps -- made not by shoes but by boots, striking not concrete but cut stone, to make a sound not twentieth-century but nineteenth -- footsteps approached, then moved on by, the sound distancing. As so often, I felt the thrill and mystery of simply <i>being</i> here, hearing those unseen late-at-night footsteps deep in the nineteenth century. Whose? Going where? For what never-to-be-known purpose? And to continue how far on into the future?<br><br>We sat against the dark carved wood of the great bedstead, snug under a thick quilt, in our nightgowns; I'd long since and absolutely refused to wear a nightcap, cold as it could get when the coals in the fireplace across the room burned out. Once in a while you're momentarily conscious of being happy. But I'm superstitious, and I picture Fate -- best be respectful, and use a capital <i>F</i> -- as a misty presence somewhere up in the sky but not too far away. Always listening, alert and ready to punish forbidden optimism. But I couldn't help it, feeling as purely content as it is possible to be, I would think, and in that moment as sometimes happens, Julia said, "Are you happy, Si?"<br><br>"Not at all. Why should I be?"<br><br>"Because of me maybe?"<br><br>"Well, okay. Right now...here in this house...Willy safely asleep across the hall, Rover snug in his bed, two drawings in the paper this week, and here in this cozy bed with you --"<br><br>"Stop that. It's much too late."<br><br>"I'm about as happy" -- I glanced at the ceiling to say, "Only fooling!" -- "as any human being could be without throwing up. That suit you?"<br><br>"Just barely better than nothing at all."<br><br>"Best I can do. Why'd you ask -- something bothering you?"<br><br>"Oh, no. It's just that you've been singing again."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Those strange songs."<br><br>"Oh Lord, I didn't realize."<br><br>"Yes. After you gave Willy his bath on Sunday, I was getting him into bed, and he was trying to sing something about 'Raindrop fai my head.' "<br><br>"Damn it, I've got to cut that out! I don't want to burden that boy with any twentieth-century knowledge, not a scrap! Not for a long time anyway. If ever. <i>This</i> is his time, the one he'll grow up and live in. And I want it to be for him just like any other -- "<br><br>"Yes, yes, don't worry, he's forgotten, it won't hurt him. It's <i>you</i> I worry about" -- she put a hand on my forearm -- "when I hear you staging those songs. You don't even know you're doing it. Sometimes you just hum, but I know it's from your own time because the tune is so odd."<br><br>That made me smile. Julia's idea of a good song -- everybody's idea -- was one her aunt had just bought, the sheet music, called "Baby's Gone to Heaven." All about a dead baby, and the cover -- a truly bad black-and-white drawing I'd have secretly buried late at night -- showed a woman, tears streaming, arms lifted toward a floating baby drifting up into a heavenly glow. Aunt Ada's boarders and friends, and some of our friends, too, would sing that kind of song standing around the organ. Some would smile, demonstrating sophisticated amusement, but most sniffled, eyes moist. And <i>my</i> songs were odd?<br><br>But I was smiling at more than songs. Here in the deep of the nineteenth century, I'd become a part of it, certainly. I knew how this time lived, thought, felt, and believed, and their ways were mine now. But like a man living permanently in another country, knowing its language and customs, becoming indistinguishably a part of it, I nevertheless carried hidden things that remained forever foreign. Things like my idea of humor and of what a song should be come from earliest childhood, and can't be changed.<br><br>"And when I hear you humming your songs," Julia said, "I know you're thinking of your time." The late twentieth century scared Julia; she hated everything she knew about it. She wanted me to be happy, but happy <i>here.</i><br><br>"Well, of course I think about my own time occasionally."<br><br><i>"Could</i> you go back, Si? Can you still do it?"<br><br>"Well...I'm not sure; it's been five years. At the Project we learned that if you can move into another time, you can usually do it again. But I really don't know. Don't want to anyway."<br><br>"Do you think others have done it?"<br><br>"Martin Lastvogel thought so; he was the teacher at the Project. He showed me an ad once, a personals ad in an 1891 <i>New York Times.</i> Said something like, 'Alice, Alice, I'm here but I can't get back! Say hello for me to the city, MOMA, the library, and Eddie and Mom. Oh, pray for me!' And he said there's a tombstone in Trinity Church cemetery that reads, 'Everett Brownlee, Born 1910, Died 1895.'

Tractor Mac and friends teach Pete and Paul that with patience and care, they too can grow a prize melon.</p><p><b>Billy Steers</b> is an author, illustrator, and pilot. In addition to the Tractor Mac series, he has worked on forty other children's books. Mr. Steers had horses and sheep on the farm where he grew up in Connecticut. Married with three sons, he still lives in Connecticut.Despite its title, this nostalgic Family Storytime title focuses most closely on a dedicated farm horse named Sibley, who is shown in all seasons doing "the work of two strong horses." Imagine poor Sibley's chagrin when Farmer Bill drives a shiny new tractor into the farmyard and the anthropomorphized machine announces to the admiring barnyard residents that he can do the work of 10 horses. Idle in the corral, a despondent Sibley listens as the other creatures sing Mac's praises and "wondered if he had been forgotten for good." But when Mac gets stuck up to his axles in the mud, trusty Sibley pulls the vehicle out, thereby earning himself a role working alongside the tractor, and the two become "the best of friends." Facile but cheerful, Steers's first book has an old-fashioned sentimentality that edges on the hokey. The bright, cartoonish artwork includes hoary details (Mac has eyes for headlights and a mouth beneath his engine vents; Farmer Bill is perpetually smiling, roly-poly and clad in overalls). For all the familiarity of the elements, however, there's a unity to the presentation, and the close-range images and the dialogue incorporating many voices will lend the book to a spirited read-aloud. As bonus bookends, the two-color endpapers label Sibley's hitchings (swingletree, crupper, rosette, etc.) and the tractor's parts in great detail.

Sam and Abby Heyworth run both Black Creek&#x2019;s organic farm and the CSA, a program where people pay to receive fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the growing season. Buyers get local produce at a reasonable price; the farmers get money to run their farm. Everybody wins!<br><br>But during a fundraising dinner showcasing the farm&#x2019;s produce, several people become seriously ill, and tests reveal that the fruits and vegetables are contaminated with deadly E. coli bacteria. Sam swears his produce is clean: E. coli doesn&#x2019;t magically appear in vegetables&#x2014;it has to be transferred by animals or contaminated equipment. And after the Heyworth&#x2019;s greenhouse is trashed and their chickens are killed by an intruder, Nancy thinks all signs point to sabotage.<br><br>Nancy, Bess, and George are on the case.

Ned Nickerson, my boyfriend, was right behind George with an amused look on his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not just vegetables,&#x201d; George said, in the frustrated tone of someone who&#x2019;d been arguing with the same person nearly since birth. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re organic, sustainable, locally grown vegetables. And fruits too!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just think it&#x2019;s all a little silly,&#x201d; Bess said as we entered the community center gymnasium, which was set up like a banquet hall, filled with round tables covered with red tablecloths and enticing combinations of fresh harvest products. A banner welcomed us: FIRST ANNUAL BLACK CREEK FARM CSA BANQUET AND HARVEST CELEBRATION.<br> <br>George glared at her cousin. &#x201c;How is organic farming silly?&#x201d; she demanded.<br> <br>Ned spoke up. &#x201c;I might see what Bess is getting at,&#x201d; he said, giving George a disarming grin. &#x201c;Not that any farming is silly, but . . . you know, scientists have been trying for years to prove that organically grown produce is better for you, and they&#x2019;ve found very little evidence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, thank you, Dr. Science,&#x201d; George grumbled.<br> <br>I was saved from further arguing by the interruption of a grinning blond woman with a purple streak in her hair.<br> <br>I held up my hands in the gesture for truce. &#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;OMG, Bess and George!&#x201d; the woman cried, appearing out of nowhere to pull the two cousins into a big hug. &#x201c;You guys are so big now! The last time I saw you, you were kids . . . now you&#x2019;re young ladies, as my grandmother would say!&#x201d;<br> <br>George and Bess exchanged glances and smiled as she slowly let them go.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holly,&#x201d; George said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re so excited that you invited us to this!&#x201d; She paused to introduce Ned and me to Holly. &#x201c;Guys, this is Holly Sinclair. She was Bess&#x2019;s and my awesome Girl Scouts leader and now she&#x2019;s assistant manager at the community center.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly shook each of our hands excitedly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy you could come!&#x201d; she said, her cheeks flushed. &#x201c;Black Creek Farm CSA is doing some really good work, trying to change the way our food gets grown,&#x201d; she continued, growing serious. &#x201c;They just need some more support from the community. So I convinced them to throw this dinner so people can taste their food!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holly, I told you,&#x201d; Bess said teasingly, &#x201c;I like organic farms and all, but we&#x2019;re not exactly the culinary decision makers in our families. And my mom really likes the Stop-N-Go,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Especially since they put in that Starbucks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly shook her head, her dark eyes shining. &#x201c;Your mom probably wouldn&#x2019;t like it so much if she knew where all that mass-produced food was coming from, or what it&#x2019;s doing to the environment,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Come on, guys, have a seat with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly led our small group to a nearby table, where we all pulled out chairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Soooo,&#x201d; Holly began, sliding into a seat next to George, &#x201c;you must know that the produce you buy in a grocery store isn&#x2019;t all from around here, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Ned said. &#x201c;But that goes without saying. Not every climate will be able to produce every fruit or vegetable there&#x2019;s demand for.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Holly agreed, &#x201c;but do you think people really consider where their food comes from, when it&#x2019;s so shiny and easy to buy at the supermarket? Maybe that orange was picked before it was ripe and flown in on a cargo jet, or else trucked around the country using tons of fossil fuels and releasing all kinds of toxins into the environment. But if people stopped and thought about eating locally, maybe they&#x2019;d select an apple that was grown down the road&#x2014;perfectly ripe and much easier to transport.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned sighed. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Local food usually tastes better too,&#x201d; George pointed out. &#x201c;Because local farmers don&#x2019;t pick their produce until it&#x2019;s ready. Produce that&#x2019;s trucked in has to be picked much earlier, and that affects the flavor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly smiled at her. &#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And we haven&#x2019;t even touched on organic versus conventional produce, and how many toxins are released into the ecosystem by conventional fertilizers and pesticides.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned spoke up. &#x201c;But scientists haven&#x2019;t found much of a nutritional difference between organic and conventionally grown food,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Holly shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but we don&#x2019;t have to look very hard to find the damage that conventional farming does to the environment.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bess thought a moment. &#x201c;Even if I can see the logic in what you&#x2019;re saying,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t do the grocery shopping, Holly. My mom does it, and she&#x2019;s big on bargains.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly nodded slowly. &#x201c;Bess, all I ask is that you listen to the presentation tonight, and if you&#x2019;re impressed, if you like the quality of the food we serve, you mention us to your mom. Or pass on some flyers I&#x2019;d be happy to give you.&#x201d; Holly turned from Bess to look at George, Ned, and me. &#x201c;That goes for all of you,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>I glanced from George to Ned. George was nodding enthusiastically, and even skeptical Ned gave Holly a small smile. &#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I agreed. While I didn&#x2019;t always eat organic, I definitely believed in being environmentally responsible. And everything Holly had said made sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, look!&#x201d; Holly pointed behind my head at a tall, gray-haired, and bearded man. She stood up and waved, and the man turned to her and nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Sam Heyworth, the man of the hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; asked Ned.<br> <br>Holly smiled. &#x201c;Sam&#x2019;s the founder and owner of the Black Creek Organic Farm and CSA.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what is a CSA, exactly?&#x201d; I asked. The term was familiar, but I wasn&#x2019;t totally sure what it meant.<br> <br>Holly&#x2019;s eyes sparkled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you asked! CSA stands for &#x2018;community-supported agriculture.&#x2019; Do you know how a CSA works?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s basically a way to help keep small farms in business, and help people who live in the suburbs get access to fresh, local, in-season produce,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;If your family joined, for example, Nancy, they would pay an up-front fee for the whole growing season&#x2014;June through November. And every week during that season&#x2014;or every other week if you bought a half share&#x2014;you&#x2019;d come to this community center to pick up the freshest, most in-season veggies and fruits that grew on the farm that week.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised my eyebrows. &#x201c;Picked that week?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty fresh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly nodded. &#x201c;Right off the farm, my friend. It&#x2019;s as fresh as it gets.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced up to see the bearded man Holly had identified as Sam Heyworth headed our way, followed by a woman about his age with short blond hair. Holly looked up at them and smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam can tell you everything you want to know about the CSA,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. &#x201c;Black Creek Farm means a lot to him, doesn&#x2019;t it, Sam?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam walked up to the table and smiled down at Holly. &#x201c;You know it does,&#x201d; he said, looking around at me and my friends. &#x201c;Hello. Friends of Holly&#x2019;s, I assume?&#x201d;<br> <br>George&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;Holly was our Girl Scouts leader,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She won&#x2019;t stop talking about your farm and CSA.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam chuckled. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m flattered,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Running Black Creek Farm is a dream of mine. I gave up a partnership at my law firm to build it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;So you were a lawyer, and now you&#x2019;re a farmer?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Sam replied. &#x201c;And I was a stressed-out, unhappy man, frankly, but now I&#x2019;m&#x201d;&#x2014;he stopped and turned to look at the blond woman, who&#x2019;d come to a stop beside him&#x2014;&#x201c;very content,&#x201d; he finished. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce my wife, Abby. She&#x2019;s given up a lot to support me in pursuing this dream.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman turned to me and my friends with a warm smile, her eyes crinkling at the corners. &#x201c;Hello, everyone,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re hungry!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re starving,&#x201d; Bess promised.<br> <br>Abby and Sam laughed. Sam glanced up, catching the eye of a thirtysomething man with short brown hair and boxy black glasses. He raised his hand, waving the man over. The man nodded, then gestured for a very pregnant woman with long red hair to follow him.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is our son, Jack, and his wife, Julie,&#x201d; Abby explained. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re from Chicago, but they&#x2019;ve been visiting us while they house-hunt in the area.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; said Jack, stopping a few feet away and looking from face to face with a quizzical look.<br> <br>Julie stopped right behind him. &#x201c;Hi, everyone,&#x201d; she said. Now that she was closer, I could see that she looked a little pale. &#x201c;Oh, gosh, I need to sit down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack looked at her with concern. &#x201c;Go have a seat!&#x201d; he said urgently. &#x201c;In fact, go grab something to eat in the kitchen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, dear,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re eating for two, remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>Julie shot a small smile at my friends and me. &#x201c;Sorry to be rude,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but I think I might take Sam up on that. I&#x2019;ve been so hungry lately!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When are you due?&#x201d; Bess asked warmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;One more month,&#x201d; Julie said, patting her round belly.<br> <br>She waved and walked toward the kitchen. I followed her with my eyes and was surprised when I heard harsh voices coming from nearby.<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . should&#x2019;ve planned for her to eat first,&#x201d; Jack was saying to his father, a sharp edge in his voice. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s eight months pregnant!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam looked hurt. &#x201c;And nobody minds her sitting down or eating early.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Jack asked in a lower voice, sneering. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want us out here shaking hands to sell your stupid vegetables?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam&#x2019;s face drooped even farther. Abby shot Jack a warning look. &#x201c;Now, Jack . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly cleared her throat. She was staring straight ahead, and I couldn&#x2019;t tell whether she&#x2019;d heard the argument and was ignoring it, or had really zoned out during the whole thing. &#x201c;I am getting hungry, Sam,&#x201d; she said, looking up at him. &#x201c;And the hall is filling up.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gestured around at the other tables. I noted that she was right; while only three or four tables had people sitting at them when we&#x2019;d arrived, now nearly all of them were populated. They were filled with a combination of men and women, young and old. I found myself feeling hopeful for Sam and Black Creek Farm. It was hard not to be touched by his enthusiasm. I hoped some of these diners would become customers.<br> <br>Jack shook his head and walked off in the direction of the kitchen, and Sam looked down at us with an awkward smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should go check with the kitchen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;re nearly ready to eat.&#x201d;<br> <br>He and Abby strode off, and I looked at my friends. George was frowning at Holly.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was weird,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Holly asked, crinkling her brow like she had no idea what George was referring to.<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t see that?&#x201d; Bess asked, her blue eyes widening in surprise. &#x201c;Jack just got pretty snarky with his dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Jack.&#x201d; Holly rolled her eyes, waving her hand like Jack wasn&#x2019;t worth worrying about. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just . . . high-strung. He gets like that with everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe he was just worried about his wife,&#x201d; he suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know Julie and Jack?&#x201d; I asked Holly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, we went to high school together,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;The two of them ended up going to the same college and then settling in Chicago after they got married. It&#x2019;s great having them back here in River Heights.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;Must be nice to reconnect with old high school friends.&#x201d;<br> <br>Holly nodded, then looked over to what I assumed was the kitchen door, where Sam was striding out. &#x201c;Ooh,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;it looks like Sam is going to speak now. That must mean dinner&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked toward the podium that had been set up at the front of the room. Sam strode up to it and gently tapped the mic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; he said, leaning in with a smile. &#x201c;Welcome to the first annual Black Creek Farm showcase and buffet dinner! I&#x2019;m so delighted that all of you could be with us tonight, and I can&#x2019;t wait for you to taste the produce we&#x2019;re growing organically and sustainably on the farm. I hope many of you will consider joining our CSA. You can grab a brochure with our membership and price info, or just come grab me later! I&#x2019;d be happy to give you details.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then his face became more serious. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, Black Creek Farm is a dream of mine, but it&#x2019;s also something I feel very passionate about. A little over a year ago, I was working as a lawyer at a high-powered firm in Chicago. I took on the case of a young man whose wife had died of salmonella poisoning. Do you know what killed her?&#x201d; He paused, looking around at the crowd. &#x201c;Spinach,&#x201d; he said finally.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right&#x2014;packaged, washed spinach. You know those salad mixes you see at the grocery store. All this woman had done&#x2014;she was only twenty-five&#x2014;was buy and eat some salad. But that salad was poisoned with salmonella, because our food system in this country is broken.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced at Ned. I expected him to be wearing his detached, skeptical look, but instead he looked stunned and totally absorbed in what Sam was saying. Bess and George seemed enthralled too. And Holly was glancing around at the crowd&#x2019;s reaction, smiling.<br> <br>As we watched, Sam went on to recount where salmonella comes from (meat), and how produce becomes tainted with salmonella (through contaminated processing equipment). I had to admit that it was shocking how easily these poisons could make their way into packaged food and how damaging they could be once they were there. But Sam went on to talk about larger problems with big corporate farms: the damage they could do to the environment, and the lack of oversight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not to mention,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;the food doesn&#x2019;t taste that good. Why would you want to eat a tomato that was picked two weeks ago, barely orange? It&#x2019;s never going to beat a tomato that ripened in the sun on my farm.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, clearing his throat. I noticed that there were tears in his eyes. He really cares about what he&#x2019;s saying, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;These are issues that affect me deeply,&#x201d; Sam finished. &#x201c;So deeply that I gave up my six-figure income and the career I&#x2019;d worked decades to build, and spent my life&#x2019;s savings on a little farm just half an hour from here, in Idaville.&#x201d; He looked up, his gaze moving from table to table. &#x201c;I can promise you this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The food from my farm has been lovingly grown and is delicious and safe for your family to eat.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I hope you all will join me on my quest to make food safer, environmentally responsible&#x2014;and delicious!&#x201d;<br> <br>Sam stepped back from the podium, and the audience erupted into applause. I clapped loudly, glancing at Ned, and saw that he was applauding heartily too. In fact, everyone at our table seemed moved by the speech&#x2014;even Bess.<br> <br>When the applause died down, Sam moved back from the podium and Abby scooted in, leaning toward the mic to announce, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll all be happy to know that the food is ready! We&#x2019;re going to start lining people up to move through the buffet line along the right wall, near the kitchen.

In this <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, Michael Lewis is our jungle guide through five of the most violent and costly upheavals in recent financial history. With his trademark humor and brilliant anecdotes, Lewis paints the mood and market factors leading up to each event, weaves contemporary accounts to show what people <em>thought</em> was happening at the time, and, with the luxury of hindsight, analyzes what actually happened and what we should have learned from experience.</p><p><strong>Michael Lewis</strong> is the best-selling author of <em>Liar&#x2019;s Poker</em>, <em>Moneyball</em>, <em>The Blind Side</em>, <em>The Big Short</em>, and <em>The Undoing Project</em>. He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife and three children.A compilation of articles by the author, one of today&#39;s most insightful chroniclers of American finance and culture, and other financial luminaries paints a vivid picture of the roads we took to get to this stage of the current economic debacle. While Jesse Boggs and Blair Hardman are both strong and effective, it&#39;s not clear what is added by the double narration. Either reader would have been fine for this basic commentary. Both render Lewis&#39;s subtle wit beautifully. The closing interview with the author is an added bonus. A good production for listeners who want some back story on how we got to this pass, and what we might expect as this economic crisis plays itself out.

His first job was to work the plow, though he suffered from relatively poor health all his life. He left home when he was seventeen and was converted in 1893, at the age of twenty-two, in the Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia. Bartleman&#x2019;s desire to preach led him to enter full-time ministry the following summer. He was ordained by the Temple Baptist Church. Although he had the opportunity to be put through college and to one day have a paying position as a pastor, he chose instead &#x201c;a humble walk of poverty and suffering,&#x201d; working in the streets and slums.<br><br> In 1897, the young minister left the Baptist ministry. He joined with the Holiness Movement and spent some time with the Salvation Army, the Wesleyan Methodists, and the Peniel Missions. He rarely stayed at one address or in one church for very long. Bartleman&#x2019;s wandering lifestyle had a tendency to depress him, even to the point where he contemplated suicide in 1899. Yet he was not entirely despondent, for in 1900 he married Anna Ladd, the matron of a school for fallen girls in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon after he was married, Bartleman joined the Wesleyan Methodists and was assigned to a pastorate in Corry, Pennsylvania. Yet this ended up being a bad experience for him, as the church was far from moving toward an emotional and expressive Holiness religion, which was Bartleman&#x2019;s spiritual focus. Bartleman headed west toward California, with his wife and the first of their four children, Esther, in tow.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1904, when the Bartlemans reached California, Frank was appointed as director of the Peniel Mission, a Holiness rescue mission in the heart of Sacramento. From there he tried to reenter the church pastoral ministry, but when this failed, he had to turn to odd jobs in order to keep his family alive. By December, he and his family had headed to Los Angeles, where hardship and tragedy awaited them. In January, Esther died, throwing Bartleman into a spell of grief; this loss, however, ultimately caused him to strengthen his commitment to ministry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout 1905, Bartleman worked largely with the Holiness churches in Los Angeles but was always on the lookout for the latest work of God. This led him to the Methodist and Baptist churches in the area, especially those connected with the revival occurring in Wales. For a time, Bartleman supported the New Testament Church, pastored by Joseph Smale. He also attended the mission at Azusa Street and established another at Eighth and Maple Streets. Bartleman&#x2019;s wandering lifestyle as a young man had prepared him for following God&#x2019;s work throughout his life, for he preached as a traveling evangelist for forty-three years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bartleman&#x2019;s more than 550 articles, 100 tracts, and six books served as a complete and reliable record of the revival at Azusa Street and throughout Los Angeles from 1905 through 1911. Bartleman&#x2019;s reports were published and republished for Holiness papers around the nation, and his reputation grew as a man who had a passion for increased unity and spiritual renewal among Pentecostals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Bartleman died on August 23, 1936, and is buried in Burbank, California.</p><h2>Library and Information Center Management (Library and Information Science Text Series)</h2><p><p>This essential, single-volume textbook supplies a comprehensive introduction to library management that addresses all the functions of management, specifically within the ever-evolving modern library environment.</p><p><br>� The latest edition of a best-selling core management text&#x2015;now in its ninth edition&#x2015;covering all the management functions of libraries and information centers</p><p>� Supplies new discussion topics, examples of management challenges, and case studies</p><p>� Provides a global perspective on library management</p><p>� Contains new discussion topics and case studies and offers supplementary online materials</p><p>� Includes "Chapter Takeaways," a list of topics that the reader should understand after reading the chapter; "Management on the Job" sections referencing a specific journal article that demonstrates the chapter topic; and "Talk about It" and "Practice Your Skills" segments that offer readers a chance to demonstrate what they are learning</p></p><p><p><b>Barbara B.

This short, disciplined, unsettling book is about a girl, Caroline, who's living with her father off the grid in the Oregon woods. One of the things I love most about this novel is how much it manages to do in so little space. Father is a wonderful, mysterious, vivid creation who manages to be compelling while not quite pinnable: Is he really what he seems? What does he want, and what has he done? And then there's Caroline herself, whose affectlessness becomes heartbreaking as the novel progresses. The mood of dread that hovers over the book culminates in a single, spectacular scene of violence, but one that's more suggested than shown. And that, really, is the novel's power: It demonstrates how the most resonant fiction is by writers who have mastered the art of absence, who have found a way to wield negative space as a literary weapon."<b>&#x2014;Hanya Yanagihara, author of <i>A Little Life </i>and <i>The People in the Trees&nbsp;</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Poignant . . . <i>My Abandonment</i> lingers in the mind, leaving you as haunted as its mesmerizing characters.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>New&nbsp;York Post</i>&nbsp;</b><br><br> &#x201c;Perspicacious.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Elle</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Riveting . . . an immediate story in all ways . . . dead-on, entrancing narration . . . impossible to stop reading . . .

We moved quickly toward the sound of running water somewhere ahead of us. Behind us we heard shouts and gunshots; flames licked the black night sky. The damp, slippery ground was uneven under our feet.<br> <br>Elsa began to cry, a piercing sound that cut through the silence of the forest. My heart raced. Would the Enforcers or the Gatekeepers hear her?<br> <br>David stopped and handed Elsa to me. She curled into my arm and I let her suck on my finger. David took the boy&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;it looked so small and fragile. The boy, clutching his bundle of clothing tightly, worked hard to keep up with David.<br> <br>The unfamiliar sounds of the woods were ominous: rustlings in the grass, branches creaking, and our own rapid breathing&#x2014;raspy and harsh. I heard the strange hooting of a bird. What kind of bird makes that noise? No time for questions. We had to travel as far and as fast as we could.<br> <br>Back in the Compound someone rang the bell that signaled a half hour till dawn. Fools! The place was on fire and still they rang bells. Soon the Citizens would stand together and say the pledge: I pledge allegiance to the Earth and to the animals of the Earth . . . making the circle sign on their foreheads, their thumb and forefinger touching.<br> <br>Dawn was our enemy. It would steal our blanket of darkness. But I soon realized that sunrise doesn&#x2019;t come to the woods like it does in the Compounds. It creeps in, wrapped in soft gray. The leafy branches overhead kept us shaded from the early light. We took advantage and kept scurrying downhill, slipping on the damp leaves, tripping over roots and rocks.<br> <br>David and the boy were a few steps ahead of me. David looked back at me, then pointed ahead. I saw the silvery reflection of a wide stream through the trees. We walked faster. David began to run, pulling the boy by the arm as he went.<br> <br>David tripped and fell, his full weight smashing against a rock, our bundle of supplies rolling ahead of him. Clutching Elsa, I ran to him. Blood seeped through the sleeve of his uniform. He groaned, sat up slowly, and cradled his right arm with his left. The boy ran ahead and retrieved our bundle. I knelt beside David and brushed some dirt from his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; he whispered. But I could tell from his voice and the look on his face that he was in pain. He struggled to stand up, and then gingerly tested his right arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not broken,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s keep moving.&#x201d;<br> <br>He started walking and we followed, each of us more careful with our steps, until we finally reached the bank above the water. I had never seen water like that before. I had only seen it in our ration bottles&#x2014;confined, measured, limited. This water danced and twirled over the stones, rippling, turning, moving with purpose. Mother had told me about lakes and rivers; I had even seen her map that revealed vast blue oceans. But this was the first time I had seen so much water with my own eyes. Overwhelmed, I stood and stared, realizing all at once that I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for what the real world looked like. I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for how big it was.<br> <br>David slid down the bank and stepped into the stream, moving from stone to stone along the edge, then into deeper water, pushing forward to the other side. The boy rushed to catch up with him. With every step, David looked back at me, beckoning me forward. He dipped his injured arm into the water, letting it flow over his sleeve, washing away some of the blood. Halfway across, the water was up to his knees. The boy held onto David&#x2019;s uniform with one hand and, with the other, held our bundle high over his head. He was wet to his waist.<br> <br>Could I follow? What if I fell and dropped Elsa? The boy looked back at me and motioned with his head, urging me to come. David stopped and called my name. &#x201c;Emmeline.&#x201d; His voice was pleading; he risked being heard. They had faith in me; they needed me. I slid down the hill, sitting, and the wetness of the earth seeped through my clothes. At the bottom, I stepped into the stream and gasped at how cold it was. But I didn&#x2019;t stop. Step by step, clutching Elsa tightly, I walked forward. The current pushed against my feet, my legs. I was so focused on not falling or dropping Elsa that my temples throbbed and I could feel my pulse in my ears like a drumbeat.<br> <br>David and the boy waited for me on the other side and together we scrambled up the steep bank, grabbing at whatever strong plants or branches we could use to pull ourselves up with using our free hands.<br> <br>Finally, we were all together at the edge of the forest. We looked below at the stream that separated us from the Compound, then turned and walked into the dimness, surrounded by the tallest trees I had ever seen. Most were straight with thick brown trunks and leafy branches reaching up. But one had green needles instead of leaves and the branches sloped down so low that they brushed the ground. David pushed the branches aside and motioned for us to crawl into the space underneath them. It smelled sweet and clean in that small, cramped space. I took a deep breath, filling my lungs with the fragrance. A few ferns grew in the dark soil, graceful in the dimpled light. I had seen ferns growing along the bicycle path in the Compound but I&#x2019;d never seen a tree like this.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll rest here,&#x201d; David whispered. &#x201c;When it&#x2019;s dark, we&#x2019;ll move on.&#x201d; He nodded his head toward the boy. &#x201c;Who is he? Why did you bring him along?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced at the boy, worried about how he&#x2019;d react to David, but his face was flat, expressionless. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain later,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Let me see your arm.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rolled up his wet sleeve. The skin was ripped from his elbow to his wrist in a long, shallow gash with uneven edges. Dark red blood, thick and sticky, oozed from it. &#x201c;It looks deeper than it is,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;We just need to keep pressure on it. You&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>He quickly rolled his sleeve back down, twisting it so it was tight against his arm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>The ground under the tree was covered with fallen needles but it was surprisingly soft. The sun had fully risen; warmth was wrapping around us, soft and moist.<br> <br>In spite of his wet clothes, the boy curled up, using a roll of diapers as a pillow, and was asleep almost instantly. David sat propped against the tree trunk. I leaned against him, my head on his chest. I could hear his heartbeat, strong and steady. Elsa, pink and warm, was safe in my arms.<br> <br>&#x201c;The boy,&#x201d; I whispered, &#x201c;was awake one night at the Village. He was near tears. Said his belly hurt. Seems that he wanted to use the washing-up area but couldn&#x2019;t. Said it was against the rules.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The rules? For the washing-up area?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. The children could only go when the Caretakers said they could. No other time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201d; David whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. So I gave him permission to break a rule. I let him go. After that, he told me he always wanted me to be with him. He said I was important because I could break the rules. I told him he was important because I broke the rule for him. He trusted me. I couldn&#x2019;t break his trust. I had to bring him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d; But David didn&#x2019;t look like he understood. He sounded worried because we were now responsible for two children. Little did David know that I wished I could have saved more of them from their cold world. All of them.<br> <br>We didn&#x2019;t talk anymore. We needed to sleep.<br> <br>I put my free hand into our bundle and tried to guess how many diapers and bottles we had. I knew there weren&#x2019;t enough of either to last for very many days.<br> <br>We spent our first day of freedom huddled under that tree, listening for the sound of footsteps in the forest and waiting for darkness so we could move on. But move on to where? Was any place safe?<br> <br>I thought back to the old photograph that Mother had kept hidden in her mat. I treasured that picture of her holding me, both of us smiling into the camera. Behind us in that photo was a sturdy home, a loving place. A safe place. Every fiber in me longed to return to that home, to a new beginning free from punishment and rules and Gatekeepers and Enforcers.<br> <br>I had the first pangs of hunger, but worse, I felt the sharp chill of fear. What if we couldn&#x2019;t find a safe place to call home? Would we die out here alone in this forest?<br> <br>I laid my head close against David&#x2019;s chest to better hear and feel his strong, steady heartbeat.<br> <br>Finally, I fell asleep.</p><h2>Schumann: Album for the Young: Opus 68 for the Piano</h2><p>Numerous selections from Schumann&#39;s Album for the Young have long been favorites of intermediate students, and few collections fail to include the &#34;Soldier&#39;s March,&#34; the &#34;Happy Farmer&#34; or the &#34;Wild Horseman.&#34; This historically informed edition of the entire collection clearly differentiates the markings of the first edition from Clara Schumann&#39;s later-edited version.

It's easier than you think. In just a couple of weeks, build a ray-tracer that renders beautiful scenes with shadows, reflections, brilliant refraction effects, and subjects composed of various graphics primitives: spheres, cubes, cylinders, triangles, and more. With each chapter, implement another piece of the puzzle and move the renderer that much further forward. Do all of this in whichever language and environment you prefer, and do it entirely test-first, so you know it's correct. Recharge yourself with this project's immense potential for personal exploration, experimentation, and discovery.</p> <p>The renderer is a ray tracer, which means it simulates the physics of light by tracing the path of light rays around your scene. Each exciting chapter presents a bite-sized piece of the puzzle, building on earlier chapters and setting the stage for later ones. Requirements are given in plain English, which you translate into tests and code. When the project is complete, look back and realize you've built an entire system test-first!</p> <p>There's no research necessary -- all the necessary formulas and algorithms are presented and illustrated right here. Dive into intriguing topics from fundamental concepts such as vectors and matrices; to the algorithms that simulate the intersection of light rays with spheres, planes, cubes, cylinders, and triangles; to geometric patterns such as checkers and rings. Lighting and shading effects, such as shadows and reflections, make your scenes come to life, and constructive solid geometry (CSG) enables you to combine your graphics primitives in simple ways to produce complex shapes.</p> <p>Play and experiment as you discover the fun of writing a ray tracer.

Challenging and instructional, these thought-provoking books present sequential exercises in logical reasoning that include relationships, analogies, syllogisms, sequences, deductive reasoning, inference, truth-values, and logical notation. Simple grids coupled with intriguing problems evoke enthusiasm and inspire students to higher and higher levels of thinking. Each book in this series builds on concepts presented previously in the series to offer a comprehensive logic adventure for young thinkers.<br><br>The skills students build by using this book are applicable to several areas of the curriculum. Academic skills used in reading, math, writing, and science all depend on the ability to perceive and define relationships, sequence events, and form inferences. But, beyond the academic world, students will find logical thinking an integral part of everyday life.<br><br>This is the second in a three-book series designed to sharpen children's logical thinking skills. Once students have mastered <i>Logic Countdown</i> they are ready to meet new challenges in <i>Logic Liftoff</i> and <i>Orbiting with Logic</i>.</p><p>Bonnie Lou Risby grew up in the Illinois woodlands atop the limestone bluffs across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. These woods were her playground where she and her siblings camped out, played detective, and enjoyed the beauty of the outdoors in every season. After attending college at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, she taught school in Columbia, IL, for 13 years. She has taught elementary school, middle school, and high school, concentrating on the subjects of French, English, and gifted education. When Risby helped write the grant to establish Columbia's Gifted Program in the early 1970s, there were few materials readily available that fit well with a one-period per week pullout program.<br><br>After the birth of her son, Risby retired from teaching and joined a family and marriage counseling practice for 12 years, continuing to write and create logic books in her spare moments. Retired from her therapy practice, she now works in a family business with her husband and son in Ballwin, MO. Risby has continued to write classroom books, chapter books, magazine articles, and books for young adults.<br><br>Besides writing, Risby loves taking float trips down Ozark streams, biking, long walks with her dog, gardening, family history, and travel.<i>Blast Off with Logic</i> is a series of three books that build upon one another at increasing levels of difficulty. <i>Logic Countdown</i>, written for grades 3-4, introduces relationships, analogies, sequencing, "all" and "no" statements, syllogisms, if-then statements, deduction, and making inferences. <i>Logic Liftoff</i> for grades 4-6 reviews and expands all of these topics, continues into deeper logical reasoning, and introduces logical notation. <i>Orbiting with Logic</i> for grades 5-7 builds on the previous two books, expands logical notation, and adds logic diagrams and logical fallacies. While it is possible to use any one of the books alone, they really work best as a sort of continuous course . . . Most of us parents will find many of the lessons new and challenging, so we should tackle them right along with our children to improve our own thinking skills. --<b>Cathy Duffy, Cathy Duffy Reviews - January 1, 2009</b></p><h2>Hip Hop Raised Me</h2><p><p><strong>The definitive volume on the massive and enduring impact of hip hop over the last forty years, now in a compact paperback edition.</strong></p><p>In 2008, with help from Jay-Z and Puff, Barack Obama got the hip hop vote, and became the first African American to be elected president. For a brief moment, the &#x201c;Audacity of Hope&#x201d; seemed attainable. The 2014 Ferguson riots signaled the end of that hope, and in 2016 the hip hop community had to grapple with the election of Donald J. Trump as Obama&#x2019;s successor. Now more than ever, hip hop artists such as J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar are the voice of the voiceless.</p><p>In the new, updated compact edition of <em>Hip Hop Raised Me.</em>, DJ Semtex examines the crucial role of hip hop in society and reflects on the positive influence it has had on his own life, and the lives of disaffected youths from generation after generation. Featuring specially commissioned photography and seminal interviews he conducted with key artists such as Jay-Z, Kanye West, Eminem, Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Nas, Semtex traces the course of hip hop from its origins in the early 1970s through its breakthrough to the mainstream and the advent of gangsta rap in the late 1980s to the global industry that it has become today.</p> 1000+ illustrations, 800 in color</p><p><p><strong>DJ Semtex</strong> hosts the UK&#x2019;s premiere hip-hop show on BBC Radio 1Xtra every Friday.

Cunningham</b>, John A. O'Brien Professor of Theology (Emeritus), University of Notre Dame <br><br>"Van Zeller embedded in my soul not just the poetry, but the reality that there can be no eternal beatitude without suffering, no crown without the cross. With his frank, practical, even workmanlike Benedictine spirituality, van Zeller showed me the operation of grace even in my pious failures. May this new, attractive edition of the book do for you what it did for me." --<b>Al Kresta</b>, President of Ave Maria Radio<br><br>"While suffering has the potential to turn us inward, it also has the potential to lead us closer to Christ.

Ms. Cornwell's work is translated into 36 languages across more than 120 countries.Kay Scarpetta, renowned criminal investigator with the National Forensic Academy in Florida, hunts another serial murderer. Basil Jenrette, imprisoned serial killer and research subject, is somehow connected. Kate Reading's narration is good; she is particularly adept at depicting the therapist's calm, controlled voice, then switching to the anger and belligerence of Moreno, former city cop. Scarpetta fans may be disappointed that her focus in this novel is forensics of the dysfunctional , rather than murder and investigative work, and that the story's ending is illogical. Some parts of the story are overly gruesome, as well. Even excellent narration and characterization can't salvage this poorly plotted mystery. One expects better from Cornwell.

Riordan<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nobody thinks of drawin&#x2019; the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This classic work offers the unblushing, unvarnished wit and wisdom of one of the most fascinating figures ever to play the American political game and win. George Washington Plunkitt rose from impoverished beginnings to become ward boss of the Fifteenth Assembly District in New York, a key player in the powerhouse political team of Tammany Hall, and, not incidentally, a millionaire. In a series of utterly frank talks given at his headquarters (Graziano&#x2019;s bootblack stand outside the New York County Court House), he revealed to a sharp-eared and sympathetic reporter named William L. Riordan the secrets of political success as practiced and perfected by him and fellow Tammany Hall titans. The result is not only a volume that reveals more about our political system than does a shelfful of civics textbooks, but also an irresistible portrait of a man who would feel happily at home playing ball with today&#x2019;s lobbyists and king makers, trading votes for political and financial favors.<br>&nbsp;<br>Doing for twentieth-century America what Machiavelli did for Renaissance Italy, and as entertaining as it is instructive, <i>Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</i> is essential reading for those who prefer twenty-twenty vision to rose-colored glasses in viewing how our government works and why.<br>&nbsp;<br>With an Introduction by Peter Quinn<br>and a New Afterword</p><p><b>George Washington Plunkitt</b> was born into poverty in New York in 1842. He had only three years of formal schooling, but this lack did not hinder him from becoming one of the most powerful men in New York City politics. He died in 1924, a renowned civic leader and a millionaire.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>William L. Riordan</b>, a newspaperman for the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, interviewed George Washington Plunkitt and preserved his philosophy for posterity. He recognized in Plunkitt an exceptional frankness that set him apart from his fellow political bosses. In <i>Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</i> Riordan admits readers into an area of life that mystified middle-class Americans at the turn of the twentieth century.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Peter Quinn</b> is a former speechwriter for Mario Cuomo and the author of <i>Banished Children of Eve: A Novel of Civil War New York.</i>&#34;This is a model of how teaching materials should be crafted. It is the clearest, most comprehensive, and most interesting discussion of Plunkitt that I have ever read.&#34;</p><h2>1900: Or; The Last President</h2><p>This little booklet was penned at the end of the 19th century, and ostensibly involves events mere years later. A work of political satire, it chastises the rise of socialism and populism, inferring their fictional rise here as disastrous and leading to chaos. It is of note here that this work, along with others by Lockwood, appear to prognosticate the current political climate of the United States and West at large- and for an apparent religious Catholic of his era, it is not altogether impossible that Lockwood- wittingly or unwittingly- tapped into some mystic forces. Regardless, it is an interesting little political story from its time and is reflective of some of the social ideologies and movements of the age.</p><p>Ingersoll Lockwood (1841-1918) was a New York attorney who wrote several children&#39;s books as well as satire and nonfiction. Best known as the author of the Baron Trump series, he wrote in a style that mixed fantasy with young-reader-oriented science fiction-a style that anticipated and may have influenced L.

They don&#x2019;t talk about their missions to anyone outside their small community. But now, Michael J. Durant and Steven Hartov shed fascinating light on the mysterious elite commandos known as SOAR (Special Operations Aviation Regiment) and take readers into a shadowy world of combat they have only imagined.</p><p>Michael J. Durant retired from the army as a Chief Warrant Officer 4. In addition to participating in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia, he saw action in the Persian Gulf, Panama, and Kuwait. His awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with Valor Device, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, three Air Medals, the POW/MIA ribbon, and the Army Commendation Medal with three Oak Leaf ClustersUntil 1980, Special Forces (Delta, SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets) relied on ad hoc transportation from other units to get to every operation. That led to disaster in 1980, when the failed Iranian hostage rescue left hulks of five helicopters in the Iranian desert. The U.S. Army decided to do it right the next time, resulting in the creation of SOAR, the Special Operations Aviation Regiment, a highly trained, aggressive unit of helicopter pilots and crew. Durant (<i>In the Company of Heroes</i>) and coauthors recount half a dozen SOAR missions from Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989 to Afghanistan and Iraq today, all with abundant fireworks and casualties. However, in this account, bravery occurs only on our side, while opponents are gleefully cackling comic-book villains blown to smithereens by America's deadly firepower. Readers who wonder why our magnificent troops are assailing, say, the Panamanian army, which no one would mistake for the Wehrmacht, have picked up the wrong book. It's written for those who love vivid tales of battlefield heroics and seek no more insight from books than they do from video games. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At first, she put her hand to her rock-and-rope <i>bola</i>, but paused when the visitor hesitated to shed her cloak, which was heavy with mud and algae. Beneath the hood, Naia saw a stern-faced Gelfling woman with long silver hair. What was a Vapra doing so deep in the Swamp of Sog? It was peculiar&#x2014;maybe even suspicious&#x2014;yet Naia felt no fearful quickening of her heart, and her hand dropped away from her <i>bola</i>. All around, the Swamp of Sog stretched and yawned for morning, the droning of buzzers and chirruping of climbers <i>crik-crik</i>ing in harmony with the great song of the world. Watching the visitor, Naia took a sour alfen fruit from her waist-pouch and munched on it in thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She must have come a long way,&#x201d; Naia murmured. Her companion, Neech, coiled in her vine-like hair, gave only a quiet burble in response, burying his head further in her dreadlocks. As the visitor resumed her journey, Naia balanced the alfen fruit&#x2019;s smooth knuckle-size pit between two ridges of apeknot bark. A quick flick of her finger sent the pit tumbling down through the spirals and twists of the tree&#x2019;s bark, disappearing into the depths of the gnarled trees. Then she followed, another flicker within the kaleidoscope of canopy shadows.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stranger spent the afternoon traveling toward the heart of the swamp. Once or twice, Naia thought about running ahead to alert her village, but she worried she might lose the visitor to quicksand or any number of hungry swamp creatures. An alternative would be to make herself known and offer help, but strangers were called <i>strange</i> for a reason. Confronting an outsider in the depths of the swamp might be just as dangerous to Naia as a swamp creature might be to the Vapra.<br> &nbsp;<br> What would have taken Naia a few hours on her own became an all-day trek. Just as the sky began to dim, the dense apeknots gave way to a circular clearing where the trees were huge and ancient, lovingly maintained by Gelfling hands. They&#x2019;d reached the home of the Drenchen clan. Naia looked from the system of boardwalks that floated on the swamp floor between the apeknots to her village above. Lattice walkways and walking-ropes connected buildings carved into the crooks of the enormous trees to those hanging from thick pendulums. A whole world suspended above the swamp.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the visitor, shining with sweat and bruises and buzzer bites, paused to catch her breath at the Glenfoot, Naia made haste toward the heart of the village. She leaped from a branch to the closest walking-rope, gripping with her bare toes as she dashed along it. At the center of the glen loomed Great Smerth, the oldest tree in the swamp, in which her family had lived for generations. Winding walkways circled its enormous trunk, studded by circle-shaped entryways and windows decorated with lush flowers and thick, dangling vines.<br> &nbsp;<br> She took a flying leap, clearing half a dozen paces and landing with a calculated <i>ka-thump!</i> on the outer landing balcony. The wingless landing made her sound like a boy, but it was unavoidable. She didn&#x2019;t have time for grace, anyway. As she shouldered through the doorway, her footsteps echoed against the golden heartwood of the rounded hall within. Friendly faces met her on the way, but she had no time to return their greetings now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mother!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Neech gave a tiny chirp of relief and fluffed the fur around his neck into place as Naia entered, breathless, into her family&#x2019;s chamber. Her mother, swathed in an embroidered cloth of deep turquoise and gold, was seated on a small stool, while Naia&#x2019;s two younger sisters wound beads and colored string into her thick locs. Maudra Laesid looked every bit the <i>maudra</i> of the Drenchen clan, her kind face patient with wisdom and young with laughter. The spots that dappled her clay-colored skin reflected the spring green in the light, and her wings shimmered like a beautiful cloak of indigo and turquoise. In her hands rested a fledgling muski, only half the size of Neech. It was ailing from a small cut that broke its slick black skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, Naia, good evening!&#x201d; said Laesid. &#x201c;You missed lunch, though I suppose you&#x2019;re in time for supper.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An outsider,&#x201d; Naia said. She plucked a damp cloth from the basin near where her sisters were tending to their mother, swabbing swamp mist off her cheeks with it. Her sisters gave her a tilted look, and she realized she hadn&#x2019;t begun at the beginning. &#x201c;This morning, on my watch. I saw an outsider enter the swamp. She&#x2019;s here now, at the Glenfoot. She seems a Vapra&#x2014;a Silverling, fair of hair and face. Mother, did you call for the All-Maudra?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Laesid said. She had not looked up from the baby eel where she held it gently in one hand, waving the other above it in a slow, circular motion. Her fingers shone with a gentle blue gathering light as if it were a palmful of crystal water. By the time the <i>maudra</i> withdrew her hand, the cut had closed and the puffiness had receded, leaving the eel to chirp in thanks before flitting away out the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eliona, the <i>maudra</i>&#x2019;s middling daughter, stood and perked her ears up with any excitement their mother failed to express. &#x201c;An outsider!&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;From the Ha&#x2019;rar? Has she brought gifts from the All-Maudra?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If she has, they&#x2019;re heavy with mud by now.&#x201d; Naia snorted. &#x201c;She took the low way. It took all day, Mother! Haven&#x2019;t Silverlings any sense in the swamp?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, they don&#x2019;t have swamps on the Vapran coast,&#x201d; Laesid replied wryly. &#x201c;You could have helped her, you know. It would have helped you, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia pressed her lips together, crossing her arms and choosing not to respond to the light scolding. Her mother always seemed to have a better solution on the tip of her tongue, no matter how much thought Naia put into her decisions. That was what being the <i>maudra</i> was all about, after all&#x2014;and Naia wasn&#x2019;t <i>maudra</i> yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anyway, what shall we do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If she was in fact sent by the All-Maudra, we had better greet her, and sooner better than later. Meet her at the Glenfoot. Pemma, summon your father, have him join Naia and our visitor. I&#x2019;ll see her in my chamber if she calls for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As Pemma, the youngest, scampered out to fetch their father, Laesid reached to the floor and grasped her crutch, leaning on it to pull herself up. Naia dried her face with her sleeve. She was unsure about greeting the visitor alone, and although she was too old for a child minder, she was secretly glad that her father would be there. There was something about the Vapra&#x2019;s arrival that was causing a worming feeling in Naia&#x2019;s gut.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; she said, quieting her voice. &#x201c;Could this be about Gurjin?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maudra Laesid shrugged, raising an open hand with no answers in it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not everything is about your brother, my dear,&#x201d; she replied, but her voice sounded uneasy, and the salt in it fed the worm in Naia&#x2019;s stomach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The last time a Silverling came&#x2014;&#x201d; she began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And not every messenger from the All-Maudra is here to take your family away,&#x201d; Laesid finished. &#x201c;Now go on, don&#x2019;t keep our visitor waiting. Show me your skill with formalities. Invite her to sup, and we&#x2019;ll see what all this huff-puff is about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Naia kept her mouth shut, unsure how to explain what she was truly feeling. When Gurjin had first been sworn into service at the Castle of the Crystal, Naia had been filled with resentment and envy. Though she and her brother were precisely the same age, same in skill and will, their fates were different. His was to respond to the summons while she remained in Sog to apprentice to her mother. It was the duty of the eldest daughter, after all. That was the way it had always been. Naia had since come to accept it, but it didn&#x2019;t stop her from hoping that one day a soldier would arrive to summon her to leave the swamp as well. Her mother, however, seemed to know better.<br> &nbsp;<br> Swallowing her pride, Naia took the Stone&#x2019;s Way: a long, twisting tunnel down to the foot of Great Smerth. She ignored the careful glances and smiles from the men and children in the winding passage as she hurried by. She worried about what they might be thinking; even Eliona&#x2019;s wings had bloomed, and she was one trine younger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Naia pushed the self-conscious thoughts out of mind. It was only a matter of time, her mother had told her: <i>Coming of age is a journey, not a destination</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Great Sun had long been at full height, its red brother peeking just along the border of the visible sky and warming the glen and shining on the pensive faces of the Drenchen scattered across the walkways and rope bridges. Above and around, Naia&#x2019;s clanfolk whispered, gray and green and brown faces peering out their carved windows at the exhausted traveler resting against the knees of a nearby root. Naia approached and took the closer look she hadn&#x2019;t been afforded earlier in the day. Unlike the sturdy Drenchen, the visitor was as skinny as a stick, with a narrow face and high, soft cheekbones. Where Naia&#x2019;s thick locs were bound in twists and ropes of black and green, the Silverling woman&#x2019;s hair hung in sad sheets of pale lavender, and though she had a proud, even brow and the posture of an adult, it would be easy to lift her with a hand and toss her back into the swamp through which she&#x2019;d come.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Naia called as she approached. Startled by her voice, the visitor&#x2019;s ears flicked toward her like delicate white cup-flowers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she replied. She spoke with an accent, shaping the word a bit sharper and shorter. Despite her weariness, she stood and did a quick, formal bow, holding the carved, unamoth-shaped brooch at the neck of her cloak.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Perhaps you can assist me. I am Tavra of Ha&#x2019;rar. I&#x2019;m hoping I might ask the inconvenience of your clan&#x2019;s hospitality&#x2014;if I could speak with your <i>maudra&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> When Tavra trailed off, Naia realized she was done speaking, even if she hadn&#x2019;t finished her sentence, letting Naia guess the rest instead of saying it out loud. Naia tongued her teeth and took on a relaxed posture while still holding her chin up, a pose that was well practiced.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The <i>maudra</i> is my mother, and I am her eldest daughter. You may speak with me in her place.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A look of relief passed over Tavra&#x2019;s long face, though her eyes still watched Naia the way she might look at a wild Nebrie, wondering whether it was dangerous or not. Was that what outsiders thought of the Drenchen? The look, and whatever words Tavra was about to utter, flitted away when Naia&#x2019;s father joined them. Bellanji was stout and heavy, with the locs of his great beard wound with string and beads, a spear held loosely in his hand as a formality that might befit the role of husband to the <i>maudra</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello there!&#x201d; Bellanji said in his big voice. &#x201c;Naia! I thought I asked you to clean your catches before bringing them to the supper table!&#x201d; Then he let out a big laugh, mostly at Tavra&#x2019;s expense, and Naia felt a little smile prick the corners of her mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Father, this is Tavra,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Of Ha&#x2019;rar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bellanji raised one thick black brow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ha&#x2019;rar, eh?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Did the All-Maudra send you? Or maybe you&#x2019;re one of her daughters! How many of them are there now? No fewer than sixty-four, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tavra&#x2019;s cheeks were so pale that they turned pink, and she raised a hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am merely a traveler who happens to hail from the home of the Gelfling All-Maudra,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have long since heard of the sights and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. smells&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Swamp of Sog. I was hoping I might ask the inconvenience of your hospitality, that I might witness all you have here for myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bellanji waited, allowing his daughter to do the decision making, though she was not <i>maudra</i> yet. Naia let the talk fall quiet, sensing something riding below Tavra&#x2019;s words. There was much the Vapra wasn&#x2019;t saying, but so far as Naia&#x2019;s instinct could tell, it was nothing more dangerous than the Drenchen clan could take care of, should trouble arise. Resolved, at least for now, she gave her father a decisive nod. His smile returned, and he stomped the butt of his spear on the boardwalk before striding away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well then, we&#x2019;ll all witness something either way, won&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; he said over his shoulder. &#x201c;Naia, find Tavra of Ha&#x2019;rar a place from which she might enjoy our hospitality. She may stay as long as she likes&#x2014;and tonight at sup, she can enjoy the sights and smells she&#x2019;s so longed for!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Though Tavra&#x2019;s request had been granted, the look on her face was hardly enthusiastic.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>That night, Tavra sat to Naia&#x2019;s left at the head table in the Feast Hall, deep in the belly of Great Smerth. After a bath and some rest, the Vapran visitor looked more noble than weary. Naia imagined their guest standing in the white stone halls of Vapra Ha&#x2019;rar, the home of the All-Maudra. From her seat, Naia had a closer view of the woman&#x2019;s face and the nervous expressions she was stifling as the servers pushed carts of traditional Drenchen fare before them. On each cart were tiered trays stacked with wide wood-and-leaf bowls filled past the brim with squirming delicacies: fuchsia wort beetles and fermented Nebrie-milk dumplings, mushroom wing-fronds, and Naia&#x2019;s favorite, blindfish plucked from the very bottom of the swamp floor. Naia took her helpings by the handful as the carts passed, piling them on the wide leaf in front of her as the drum singers played and sang from the balcony overlooking the bustling hall. &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where are&#x2014;&#x201d; Tavra began, glancing up and down the long table before rethinking her question and trying again. &#x201c;Do you use eating utensils?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Skewers,&#x201d; Naia said. She gestured at the reed cup holding a dozen pointed eating skewers at the end of the table, near Gurjin&#x2019;s usual place and the only empty chair. Tavra shook her head, looking paler than usual as Naia slurped a wriggling white blindfish whisker. After a few carts had passed, hunger finally got the better of her, and she reached for one of the leafier dishes as it passed, only to find it was seasoned with crawling, furry algae. In the beginning, Naia struggled to contain her amusement at Tavra&#x2019;s dilemma, but she soon felt a drop of pity in her heart for the poor woman and pushed her chair back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, Neech. Let&#x2019;s find something that our guest can catch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Neech stirred from his coil around her neck, his slippery skin sliding until he balanced over her shoulder and stretched his webbed wings. He gave a little chirp and darted out to catch a leaf hopper that had hopped too far from the table, munching on it lazily while Naia wove between the cart servers and the gregarious group of feasting Gelfling.

What would have been the impact of such intense creative talent on twentieth-century furniture? Today there is a man with this quality of profound artistic vision and talent who has devoted his life to making furniture. His name is Sam Maloof, and this book is his life and work told in his own words.<br>Sam Maloof started making furniture immediately after World War II, when there was very little demand for hand-made objects. His perseverance through 'years of difficulty is a testament to the depth of his love for wood and for working with it. Since childhood, Sam has also been in love with technique and has constantly developed his precise sense of form and design. These three loves-of wood, of making things, and of designbrought him to the world of furniture and eventually to an honored place among America's leading artistcraftsmen.<br>As with true great art, everything Sam Maloof makes seems simple. His furniture has a clear rhythm and flow, a bright vitality that eludes analysis. All his furniture is functional: chairs are comfortable; tables, while sculptural, are still tables to be used; desks are custom-designed to meet the needs of each user. Though Maloof furniture designs are all intensely his own, they remain unassuming and natural. His work has the calm, sure quality that comes from technical mastery combined with a creative joy in finding ways to let wood speak. A first encounter with a piece of Maloof furniture is like meeting a friend from the past-the warmth of relationship is immediate and delightful. This warmth never pales.<br>The qualities of his work are mirrored in the artist. Sam is open, direct, and gracious. He projects a feeling of affable dignity and goodwill, and he works with the ease and clarity seen in his furniture. Work for him is not drudgery. It is a renewal, an affirmation.<br>He and his wife, Alfreda, live in a meandering house that nestles in a lemon orchard at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, near San Bernardino, California. Sam has been building and expanding the house for thirty years. It unfolds as a series of surprises, from Sam's workshop at one end to the new guestroom at the other. Every room contains the ceramics, woodwork, textiles, baskets, Pictures, and other beautiful things that nourish the Maloofs and give them pleasure.<br>Sam Maloof's technical mastery of woodworking is coupled with mature, strongly personal artistic expression. He has set a standard for his craft in North America and the world. Future generations of craftsmen will see him as one of the major artistic lights of this century.</p><p><b>SAM MALOOF</b> was born in Chino, California, of Lebanese parents. He embarked on his career in furniture in 1948 and in 1959 and 1963 was sent to Iran, Lebanon, and El Salvador as a woodworking design consultant. He has exhibited actively and widely throughout the United States and also in the Vatican. His pieces are in numerous American museum collections and in the VicePresident's house and the White House. He has received many awards, given workshops, and has been a consultant and exhibition juror. He has been featured in articles and books and is the subject of the films Sam Maloof: Woodworker, by Maynard Orme, and Sam MaloofThe Rocking Chair, by Bob Smith.

She chronicles the many accomplishments in America of Chinese immigrants and their descendents: building the infrastructure of their adopted country, fighting racist and exclusionary laws, walking the racial tightrope between black and white, contributing to major scientific and technological advances, expanding the literary canon, and influencing the way we think about racial and ethnic groups. Interweaving political, social, economic, and cultural history, as well as the stories of individuals, Chang offers a bracing view not only of what it means to be Chinese American, but also of what it is to be American.</p><p>Iris Chang&#x2019;s numerous honors include the John T. and Catherine D. MacArthur Foundation&#x2019;s Program on Peace and International Cooperation Award. Her work has appeared in many publications, including the <b>New York Times</b>, <b>Newsweek</b>, and&nbsp;the <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. She is also the author of the bestselling&nbsp;<b>The Rape of Nanking</b>, available from Penguin.The story of the Chinese in America is the story of a journey, from one of the world's oldest civilizations to one of its newest. The United States was still a very young country when the Chinese began arriving in significant numbers, and the wide-ranging contributions of these immigrants to the building of their adopted country have made it what it is today. An epic story that spans one and a half centuries, the Chinese American experience still comprises only a fraction of the Chinese diaspora. One hundred fifty years is a mere breath by the standards of Chinese civilization, which measures history by millennia. And three million Chinese Americans are only a small portion of a Chinese overseas community that is at least 36 million strong.<p>This book essentially tells two stories. The first explains why at certain times in China's history certain Chinese made the very hard and frightening decision to leave the country of their ancestors and the company of their own people to make a new life for themselves in the United States. For the story of the emigration of the Chinese to America is, like many other immigration stories, a push-pull story. People do not casually leave an inherited way of life. Events must be extreme enough at home to compel them to go and alluring enough elsewhere for them to override an almost tribal instinct to stay among their own.</p><p>The second story examines what happened to these Chinese �migr�s once they got here. Did they struggle to find their place in the United States? Did they succeed? And if so, how much more difficult was their struggle because of the racism and xenophobia of other Americans? What were the dominant patterns of assimilation? It would be expected that the first-arriving generations of Chinese, like the first generations of other immigrant groups, would resist the assimilation of their children. But to what degree, and how successfully?</p><p>This book will also dispel the still pervasive myth that the Chinese all came to America in one wave, at one time. Ask most Americans and even quite a few Americans of Chinese descent when the Chinese came to the United States, and many will tell you of the mid-nineteenth-century Chinese laborers who came to California to chase their dreams on Gold Mountain and ended up laying track for the transcontinental railroad.</p><p>More than one hundred thousand Chinese laborers, most from a single province, indeed came to America to make their fortunes in the 1849-era California gold rush. But conditions in China were so bad politically, socially, and economically that these �migr�s to California represented just a small part of the single biggest migration out of that country in history. Many who left China at this time went to Southeast Asia or elsewhere. Those who chose America were relying on stories that there was enough gold in California to make them all rich quickly, rich enough to allow them to return home as successes, and the decision to leave their ancestral homeland was made bearable only by the promise they made themselves: that no matter what, they would one day return. But most stayed, enduring prejudice and discrimination, and working hard to earn a living, and their heritage is the many crowded Chinatowns dotting America from San Francisco to New York. Of their descendants, however, very few are still laborers or living in Chinatowns; many are not even recognizably Chinese because, like other immigrant groups, their ancestors intermarried. If we restrict the definition of Chinese American to only full-blooded Asians with an ancestral heritage linking them to China, we would exclude the many, many mixed-race descendants of Chinese immigrants.</p><p>This is just the beginning of the story. In terms of sheer numbers, the majority of Chinese in America probably have no forty-niner ancestors; they are, as I am, either part of later waves or children of those who arrived here more than a century after the gold rush. Life in China had changed dramatically over those one hundred years and sent a second, very different wave of immigrants. After the 1949 Communist revolution, many bureaucrats, professionals, and successful businessmen realized that their futures were not in China. They packed their belongings, often in extreme haste, and left the land of their ancestors. My own parents and grandparents belonged to this group of refugees. For some the destination was America, for others it was Hong Kong, but for most people, such as my family, the next stop would be Taiwan. These �migr�s were devoted anti-Communists who longed to return to their homeland. Indeed, many Nationalist legislators considered themselves the official ruling body of China, now forced by wartime expediency to occupy a temporary capital on an offshore island. However, their children were different. For many young Chinese in Taiwan in the 1950s and 1960s, nothing was more prestigious or coveted than a scholarship to a top American university. The Nationalist government in Taiwan imposed a restriction on those who wanted to study in the United States-they had to be fluent in English.</p><p>Thus making up the second major wave of Chinese coming to America were not just the anti-Communist elites but their most intellectually capable and scientifically directed children. Like many of their peers, my parents came to the United States on scholarships, obtained their doctoral degrees, and later became professors. And across the country, their friends-doctors, scientists, engineers, and academics-shared the same memories and experiences: a forced exile from the mainland as children, first in Taiwan and then in the United States.</p><p>Most of these newest �migr�s did not find their way to the old Chinatowns, other than as tourists, but instead settled in the cities and suburbs around universities and research centers. Because they saw themselves as intellectuals rather than refugees, they were concerned less about preserving their Chinese heritage than with casting their lot with modern America, and eventual American citizenship. It is in connection with these immigrants, not surprisingly, that the term "model minority" first appeared. The term refers to an image of the Chinese as working hard, asking for little, and never complaining. It is a term that many Chinese now have mixed feelings about.</p><p>Not all of those who arrived here during the mid-twentieth-century second wave were part of this success story, however. Many entered not as students but as political refugees, and often they did end up in American Chinatowns, only to be exploited as cheap labor in factories and restaurants. The arrival of these two disparate contingents in the 1950s and 1960s created a bipolar Chinese community in America, sharply divided by wealth, education, and class.</p><p>The story does not end here either. A third wave entered the United States during the last two decades of the twentieth century. Interestingly, this large wave encompassed Chinese of all socioeconomic groups and backgrounds, who arrived as Sino-American relations thawed and as the People's Republic of China (PRC) began its rocky transition from a pariah communist state to a tenuously connected capitalist one.</p><p>Although the three waves came at different times and for different reasons, as Chinese Americans they shared certain common experiences. In the course of writing this book, I discovered that the Chinese in general brought distinctive cultural traits to America-such as reverence for education, hard work, thriftiness, entrepreneurship, and family loyalty-which helped many achieve rapid success in their adopted country. Many Chinese Americans, for example, have served an important "middleman minority" role in the United States by working in occupations in which they act as intermediaries between producers and consumers. As economist Thomas Sowell has noted, middleman minorities typically arrive in their host countries with education, skills, or a set of propitious attitudes about work, such as business frugality and the willingness to take risks. Some slave away in lowly menial jobs to raise capital, then swiftly become merchants, retailers, labor contractors, and money-lenders. Their descendants usually thrive in the professions, such as medicine, law, engineering, or finance.</p><p>But as with other middleman minorities, the Chinese diaspora generally found it easier to achieve economic and professional success than to acquire actual political power in their adopted countries. Thus the Chinese became, in the words of historian Alexander Saxton, "the indispensable enemy": a people both needed and deeply feared. Throughout history, both the U.S. government and industry have sought to exploit Chinese labor-either as raw muscle or as brain power-but resisted accepting the Chinese as fellow Americans. The established white elite and the white working class in the United States have viewed the Chinese as perpetual foreigners, a people to be imported or expelled whenever convenient to do one or the other. During an economic depression in the nineteenth century, white laborers killed Chinese competitors and lobbied politicians to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act. Later, in the twentieth century, the United States recruited Chinese scientists and engineers to strengthen American defense during the Cold War, only to harbor suspicions later that some Chinese might be passing nuclear secrets to the PRC.</p><p>The great irony of the Chinese American experience has been that success can be as dangerous as failure: whenever the ethnic Chinese visibly excelled-whether as menial laborers, scholars, or businessmen-efforts arose simultaneously to depict their contributions not as a boon to white America but as a threat. The mass media have projected contradictory images that either dehumanize or demonize the Chinese, with the implicit message that the Chinese represent either a servile class to be exploited, or an enemy force to be destroyed. This has created identity issues for generations of American-born Chinese: a sense of feeling different, or alien, in their own country; of being subjected to greater scrutiny and judged by higher standards than the general populace.</p><p>Another important theme has been the struggle of Chinese Americans for justice. A long history of political activism belies the myth that Chinese Americans have stood by and suffered abuse as silent, passive victims. Instead, from the very beginning, they fought racial discrimination in the courts, thereby creating a solid foundation of civil rights law in this country, often to the benefit of other minorities. But with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, large-scale Chinese immigration ceased entirely for eighty years, and at one point the ethnic Chinese population in the United States dwindled to only a few tens of thousands of people. Only new legislation in the middle of the twentieth century permitted the second and third waves of Chinese immigrants to arrive, forcing these newcomers to start almost from scratch as they built their own political coalitions. But build them they did.</p><p>The stories in this book reveal the ever precarious status of the Chinese community in America. It has historically been linked to the complex web of international politics, and more recently to the relationship between two of the world's great powers, the United States and China. When Sino-American relations are excellent, the Chinese Americans benefit as goodwill ambassadors and role models, serving as cultural and economic bridges between the two countries; but when Sino-American relations deteriorate, the Chinese Americans have been vilified as enemies, traitors, and spies-not just in the United States, but in mainland China. To describe the vulnerability of his people, one Chinese American aptly called them "an egg between two big plates."</p><p>Throughout history, some Chinese immigrants and even their American-born children adopted the na�ve and misguided notion that if things turned sour for them in the United States, they could always "go back to China." But as some would learn the hard way, to do so could be dangerous: during the Korean War and the Cultural Revolution, a number of returning Chinese were persecuted in mainland China because of their former association with the United States. Ronald Takaki, an ethnic studies professor at the University of California at Berkeley, once called the Chinese and other Asian Americans "strangers from a different shore." I propose to take this a step further. At various times in history, the Chinese Americans have been treated like strangers on both shores-a people regarded by two nations as too Chinese to be American, and too American to be Chinese.</p><p>When I was in junior high school in the early 1980s, a white classmate once asked me, in a friendly, direct manner, "If America and China went to war, which side would you be on?" I had spent all of my twelve years in a university town in Illinois and had never visited either mainland China or Taiwan. Before I could even answer the first question, she continued, "Would you leave and fight for China? Or try to support China from the U.S.?" All I could think of at that moment was how disastrous such a scenario would be for the Chinese American population, who would no doubt find themselves hated by both sides. I don't remember my exact response, only that I mumbled something along the lines that, if possible, I would try to work for some kind of peace between the two countries.</p><p>Her question, innocently put, captures the crux of the problem facing the ethnic Chinese today in America. Even though many are U.S. citizens whose families have been here for generations, while others are more recent immigrants who have devoted the best years of their lives to this country with citizenship as their goal, none can truly get past the distinction of race or entirely shake the perception of being seen as foreigners in their own land. Not until many years later did I learn that this very question has been posed to numerous prominent ethnic Chinese throughout American history, ranging from a brilliant aeronautics professor to a political candidate for Congress. Indeed, the attitudes and assumptions behind this question would later drive much of the anti-Chinese antagonism I have had to describe to make this book an honest chronicle of the Chinese experience in the United States. My classmate unwittingly planted the seed in my psyche that grew into this book.</p><p>But it was not until the mid-1990s, when my husband and I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, that I really became interested in the history and complexity of the Chinese American population. I learned about a nonprofit organization that would later be known as the Global Alliance for Preserving the History of World War II in Asia, whose mission was to educate the world about the unrecognized wartime horrors committed by Japan in the Pacific theater. For the first time in my life, I met Chinese Americans who were not simply academics or scientific professionals, but committed activists, driven by idealism I had seen only in organizations such as Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union. These Chinese Americans, working with leaders of other ethnic groups, were outspoken on a wide range of human rights abuses around the globe. Learning from them led me to write The Rape of Nanking, ...</p></p><h2>Gullah Images: The Art of Jonathan Green</h2><p>In his art Jonathan Green paints the world of his childhood and an ode to a people imbued with a profound respect for the dignity and value of others - the Gullah people of the South Carolina barrier islands. His vibrant canvases, beloved for their sense of jubilation and rediscovery, evoke the meaning of community in Gullah society and display a reverence for the rich visual, oral, and spiritual traditions of its culture. His art reveals a keen awareness of the interpersonal, social, and natural environments in which we live.</p><p>The Gullah population of South Carolina's barrier islands descends from the people of West Africa's Gold Coast. Most of the barrier islands did not have transportation to the mainland until 1940; some still don't. This isolation guaranteed that the Gullah would experience little North American acculturation. Jonathan Green was born into this society and, through his paintings, has become one of its chroniclers. The more than 180 handsomely reproduced paintings included here capture the vibrancy of the Gullah community. Many of Green's subjects--weddings, funerals, cooking, storytelling--possess a timeless quality, but there are other more contemporary scenes, too, including a blues singer and a group of sunbathers. Whatever their subject, Green's paintings are marked by a richness of tone and spirit and an energy that reaches out from the canvas. As author Pat Conroy says in his introduction, "The Gullah people depicted in Jonathan Green's world look as if they got dressed while staring at rainbows." Informative essays about Gullah history and life add to the book's considerable appeal. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Jonathan Green uses his art to paint his childhood world and images of a people immersed in Afro-American culture and island living. Over a hundred and eighty color images of Green's work represents everyday lives and regional celebrations in the Gullah area, providing a fine showcase of not only Green's talents, but the lives of a community. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>When French Women Cook: A Gastronomic Memoir with Over 250 Recipes</h2><p>Part memoir, part cookbook, this classic of food literature is an immersion course in authentic, regional French home cooking from a world-renowned culinary authority.<br><br>As a young woman, Madeleine Kamman developed her passion for food by working in the kitchens of France&#x2019;s most respected regional cooks.

Instead of raiding Paul's most famous letter for a passage here or a theme there, leading New Testament scholar Beverly Roberts Gaventa invites us to linger in Romans. She asks that we stay with the letter long enough to see how Romans reframes our tidy categories and dramatically enlarges our sense of the gospel.<br><br>Containing profound insights written in accessible prose and illuminating references to contemporary culture, this engaging book explores the cosmic dimensions of the gospel that we read about in Paul's letter. Gaventa focuses on four key issues in Romans--salvation, identity, ethics, and community--that are crucial both for the first century and for our own. As she helps us navigate the book of Romans, she shows that the gospel is far larger, wilder, and more unsettling than we generally imagine it to be.</p><p>"Using contemporary cultural illustrations from sources as varied as Terrence Malick's <i>The</i> <i>Tree of Life</i> and Bruce Springsteen's 'Land of Hope and Dreams,' Beverly Roberts Gaventa delightfully clarifies Paul's complex message in Romans. In beautifully written prose that is as compellingly clear for the novice as it is exegetically convincing for the scholar, Gaventa reminds us of the cosmic, liberative power of Paul's message. Here is that book of uncommon quality: easily accessible and utterly indispensable. Reading Romans today? Start here."<br>--<b>Brian Blount</b>, Union Presbyterian Seminary<br><br>"This is a book the church has long needed. Professor Gaventa pulls back the thin veneer of familiarity to introduce us to the high drama in Paul's Letter to the Romans. Her writing is both scholarly and accessible, ancient and contemporary, theological and pastoral."<br>--<b>M. Craig Barnes</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"From the beginning of the Christian era until the present day, Paul's Letter to the Romans has been the source of revolutionary rethinking. Nowhere do we come closer to the radical heart of the gospel. The universal and cosmic notes of the Pauline symphony are sounded in this book by one of our most esteemed interpreters of the apostle's letters. Beverly Gaventa has written a book for ordinary parish clergy and laypeople that is fun to read and full of spicy references to popular culture, and that will jolt readers into a new appreciation for the great apostle and his unique place in the history of Christian theology."<br>--<b>Fleming Rutledge</b>, author of <i>Not Ashamed of the Gospel: Sermons on Romans</i> and <i>The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ<br></i><br>"No one makes Romans come alive quite like Beverly Gaventa. In this highly accessible but provocative book--aimed at a wide Christian audience--she challenges our domesticated construals of Paul's gospel with a vision of God's comprehensive saving agency. If the starting point and the primary subject matter of the letter is not us but God, we are suddenly liberated from our excessive anxieties about ourselves, the church, and 'ethics.' Here are 3-D lenses to see Romans, the gospel, and the reality of God's grace, power, and mystery in a new and exciting way."<br>--<b>John M.&nbsp;G. Barclay</b>, Durham University<br><br>"<i>When in Romans</i> is deceptively accessible and lighthearted, so that readers are not immediately aware of being drawn into deep and rewarding engagement with Paul's complex text. But once inside and grappling with its intricacies, they are led securely through by Beverly Gaventa's experienced and unfailing judgment."<br>--<b>Carolyn Osiek, RSCJ</b>, Brite Divinity SchoolWhen reading the book of Romans, we often focus on the quotable passages, not staying long enough to grasp some of the big ideas it contains. Beverly Roberts Gaventa invites us to linger in Romans so we can see how Paul's most famous letter reframes our tidy categories and dramatically enlarges our sense of the gospel.<br><br>"Anyone who has difficulty imagining that a book on Paul's Epistle to the Romans could be a 'page-turner' should read this one. Beverly Roberts Gaventa's prose is compelling, her insights on Romans are startlingly original, and her ability to show us in Paul's letter 'the gospel in its vastness' is simply breathtaking. This book is to be savored."<br>--<b>Thomas G. Long</b>, Candler School of Theology, Emory University<br><br>"There are many books on Romans, but none quite like this one. Steeped in learning but accessible to a broad spectrum of readers, written with pastoral insight and welcome flashes of humor, here is a gift to Christians and inquirers alike. Gaventa invites us to enter the grand metropolis that is Romans, wander in its streets, relish its conversations, and be made new by its radical Lord."<br>--<b>Susan Grove Eastman</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Beverly Gaventa has produced that rarest of books, combining careful, exquisite scholarship with her eye for humanizing, delightful detail. Her writing is both sophisticated and accessible as she tackles Paul's complex notions of individual and cosmic salvation. I am one of those Gaventa identifies who, more frequently than I like to admit, opted for the Gospel reading rather than grappling with Paul's sometimes tortured logic.

We have been drinking as long as we have been human, and for better or worse, alcohol has shaped our civilization. <i>Drink</i> investigates the history of this Jekyll and Hyde of fluids, tracing mankind's love/hate relationship with alcohol from ancient Egypt to the present day.<br><br> <i>Drink</i> further documents the contribution of alcohol to the birth and growth of the United States, taking in the War of Independence, the Pennsylvania Whiskey revolt, the slave trade, and the failed experiment of national Prohibition. Finally, it provides a history of the world's most famous drinks-and the world's most famous drinkers. Packed with trivia and colorful characters, <i>Drink</i> amounts to an intoxicating history of the world.</p><p>Iain Gately is the author of <i>Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization</i>. Raise in Hong Kong, he studied law at Cambridge University and worked in the financial markets of London, where he currently lives.<p>Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley </p><p></p><p> Iain Gately, a British writer who six years ago published Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization, now turns his attention to booze, a subject, it goes without saying, of similar character but considerably larger import. Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol, is thorough, informative, briskly readable and witty. It is likely to be enjoyed more by those who take the occasional (or more than occasional) drink than by those who do not, but a central theme should be of interest to all readers: Like it or not, alcohol has been and always will be with us, an important part of human history, culture and society. It can't be wished away, as should be understood by Americans above all, having suffered through Prohibition and its appalling consequences. </p><p>Better, instead, to face up to the inescapable reality of it and try to understand the many ways in which, over the ages, we have used and abused it, profited and suffered from it, refined it and been changed by it. Gately gets down to that business in his opening paragraph: </p><p></p><p>"Alcohol is a fundamental part of Western culture. It is the most controversial part of our diet, simultaneously nourishing and intoxicating the human frame. Its equivocal influence over civilization can be equated to the polar characters of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. At times its philanthropic side has appeared to be in the ascendant, at others the psychopath has been at large. Throughout history, the place of alcohol in our meals, medicines, and leisure activities has been a matter of fierce debate. Whereas some cultures have distinguished it as a sacred fluid, whose consumption should be limited to ceremonial occasions, others have treated it as a kind of food and ignored, or accommodated, any incidental effects that it might have upon the psyche, and a few have even tried to exclude it from society altogether. Such differing views have often been concurrent, thus increasing the mystery surrounding alcohol. In both ancient Greece, and the present millennium, it has been credited with the powers of inspiration and destruction." </p><p></p><p>To the ancient Greeks, alcohol was an essential part of a civilized society: "Our word wine derives from their oin, whose consumption was considered to be both one of the defining characteristics of Hellenic civilization and a point of difference between its members and the population of the rest of the world, whom they termed barbaroi, or barbarians." Rome, "the next great drinking civilization to emerge in the classical world," was transformed "from a sober society, suspicious of both alcohol and drunkenness, to a major producer, populated with practiced and discriminating drinkers," and as its empire spread, so too did its permissive attitudes toward alcohol. </p><p></p><p>Though Christianity is often associated in the popular mind with opposition to alcohol, the historical truth suggests otherwise. From the beginning, "the single most important rite of the Christians was the ceremony of the Eucharist, at which they gathered to share bread and wine, in accordance with the instructions of their founder," yet Christianity "differentiated this sacred obligation from secular tippling, which it discouraged, except in moderation." Later, holy orders, in particular the Cistercians, played essential roles in the development of sophisticated techniques for making wine and beer, and to this day some beverages are closely identified with their monastic origins. </p><p>The subsequent history of alcohol is one of growth in consumption and acceptance punctuated by periods of reaction and temperance. In the Middle Ages it was the universal "panacea, recommended by such luminaries as Arnald of Villanova (d. 1315) as a cure for almost any ailment." In his Big Book of Distillation (1512), Hieronymous Braunschweig wrote of aqua vitae: "It eases diseases coming of cold. It comforts the heart. It heals all old and new sores on the head. It causes a good color in a person . . . it eases the pain in the teeth and causes sweet breath . . . it heals the short-winded. It causes good digestion and appetite . . . and takes away belching . . . . It gives also courage in a young person and causes him to have a good memory." </p><p></p><p>The development of distillation -- which was discovered and perfected by Muslims -- greatly altered the world of alcohol. The rise of strong drink, especially rum and gin, had repercussions far beyond the mere consumption of alcohol. Rum was a driving force in the slave trade and contributed mightily to many celebrated New England fortunes. It was also used by colonists as a "gift or sweetener" for Native Americans, whose fondness for and susceptibility to it produced unhappy repercussions that persist into the 21st century. Gin became common in England in the early 1700s, setting London off on a prolonged, spectacular and destructive spree: "In 1700, the average English adult drank a third of a gallon of gin per annum. By 1723, statistics suggested that every man, woman, and child in London knocked back more than a pint of gin per head per week," resulting in "shocking levels of drunkenness," chiefly among the poor. Gin was employed by the British elite to distract and palliate the poor, but finally things got so bad that corrective legislation was enacted, and the binge abated. </p><p></p><p>Whisky -- spelled with an "e" in the American colonies -- was a part of the heritage of the Scotch Irish and was distilled wherever they settled, hence the great single malts of Scotland and the equally great if entirely different bourbons of Kentucky and Tennessee. The imposition in 1791 by the new federal government of an excise on whiskey was vehemently opposed in Pennsylvania and led to the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, one of the first important challenges to George Washington's authority, one he met swiftly and firmly. </p><p></p><p>Young America unquestionably was a nation of boozers: "In 1810 federal statistics show that the six main whiskey-producing states together distilled twice as many gallons of whiskey per annum as there were people in America . . . . If statistics could predict the effect of drink on a population, by rights Americans should have been languishing en masse in emaciated heaps, their birthrate and life expectancy should have collapsed, and crime should have exploded." </p><p></p><p>None of this happened, but these excessive drinking habits led, perhaps inevitably, to the temperance movement, which has been a persistent presence in American life. It too has had its excesses, most catastrophically Prohibition, but organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) have had a positive influence in encouraging, if not abstinence, moderation. "The forces of temperance were on the rise in the 1980s," Gately writes, "and better provided than ever before with medical and statistical ammunition to take on the demon drink. Moreover, a dry spirit permeated the age. American consumption was in decline . . . . Consumer tastes were changing. It was chic to look tanned, trim, and toned." That is true today, but my own observation suggests that the 20-something urban professionals of 2008 are more into alcohol than were their counterparts two decades ago. </p><p></p><p>In taking us from ancient Greece to MADD, Gately doesn't miss a beat, at least none that I can identify. From the Australian wine industry to boozing as a "male prerogative" in Japan; from Louis Pasteur's discovery in 1862 of the central role played by yeast in converting "the sugars in wine and beer to alcohol"; from the fad for absinthe and its eventual prohibition in many places; from the shift away from saloons to drinking at home; to the staggering popularity in Hong Kong of French Cognac -- it's all here, authoritatively and often amusingly recounted. As an example of the latter, I have special fondness for this paragraph: </p><p>"Other British writers followed [Oscar] Wilde west [in the 1880s], and all were equally enamored with the liquid hospitality they received in Pacific America. Rudyard Kipling, who found San Francisco a 'mad city -- inhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people whose women are of remarkable beauty,' was much taken by the Pisco punch, a drink then in vogue, whose principal ingredient was a clear Peruvian brandy. Sweet to the taste, yet highly potent, this ambrosia inspired Kipling to speculate on its composition: 'I have a theory it is compounded of cherubs' wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset, and fragments of lost epics by dead masters.' " </p><p></p><p>Enough. Since this review began by quoting Gately's opening words, let's end it with his closing ones: "Salud, Kan pei, Chin-chin, Prost, Yum sing, Skol, Slainte, � votre sant�, Na zdrowie, The king o'er the water, or just plain Cheers!" </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Both are the archetypes in us, based on the gods and goddesses in Greek mythology. People are complex, there is a pantheon of these archetypes in each of us. They act from within us, and the more we know of them, the more conscious we can be about ourselves, the better. Every archetype is a predisposition each contributes to our personality, helping define our strengths, difficulties, and meaning. Families and cultures favor some archetypes over others, which affects success and self-esteem. On a personal level, individuals who find themselves repeatedly attracted to certain types need to know "who" it is in them and in the other person. I hope that people who read both books, will come away with a respectable knowledge of Greek mythology, a working understanding of Jungian archetypal psychology, and on a personal level, with insights into themselves and the significant people in their lives.<p>In this enlightening companion volume to the bestselling <em>Goddesses in Everywoman</em>, Jean Shinoda Bolen introduces men's inner patterns in the guise of eight archetypal gods.

Black women "shift" by altering the expectations they have for themselves or their outer appearance. They modify their speech. They shift "White" as they head to work in the morning and "Black" as they come back home each night. They shift inward, internalizing the searing pain of the negative stereotypes that they encounter daily. And sometimes they shift by fighting back.</p> <p>With deeply moving interviews, poignantly revealed on each page, <em>Shifting</em> is a much-needed, clear, and comprehensive portrait of the reality of African American women's lives today.</p></p><p><p>Charisse Jones is a national correspondent for <em>USA Today</em>.

The results are here compiled to form an urgent narrative, doggedly chasing the hypothesis of the book's title: that the twin bigotries of race and gender force black women to constantly "shift" between identities in order to accommodate the expectations thrust upon them by black men and white America. "From one moment to the next, they change their outward behavior, attitude, or tone, shifting `white,' then shifting `Black' again, shifting `corporate,' shifting `cool.' " The authors argue that the contemporary survival tactic of shifting is rooted in slavery, but history does not figure strongly, with the bulk of the book composed of quoted testimonies from the research subjects, tracking their shifting experiences in the realms of communication, mental health, beauty standards, romance, child-rearing and religion. Compelling and educational tribulations are piled on, but the authors rarely pause to reflect on the contradictions or solutions the stories present. Yet the book makes a real contribution, as men and women of all races will find it an illuminating if sometimes shocking record of life between two "isms."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Amalia&#39;s Guatemalan Kitchen - Gourmet Cuisine with a Cultural Flair</h2><p>Best Seller and Winner of 9 International Awards, including Best Foreign Cuisine Book USA by Gourmand World Cookbook Awards<p>Enjoy fresh, simple, and authentic Guatemalan cuisine right from your own kitchen! </p><p>Amalia Moreno-Damgaard, a Guatemalan-American chef classically educated in the French culinary tradition, shares 170 of her favorite Guatemalan recipes for every occasion in her first cookbook aimed at home cooks.

Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations.</p><p>The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.</p></p><p>Sinclair B.

Accidental Cure refers to a discovery that Dr. Simon Yu made in Bolivia during a U.S. Army Reserves assignment in 2000. The Army was there to dispense anti-parasite drugs to 10,000 Bolivians. In the few weeks that Dr. Yu worked with patients in Bolivia, he noticed remarkable changes in patient health and decided to try the drugs in his practice when he returned to St. Louis. Dr. Yu had [and continues to have] startling results with anti-parasite drugs. There are many case studies in his book that describe incurable diseases that disappear when parasites are removed. Many times, the same patients that have parasites, also need mercury removal, chelation and nutritional supplements. Diseases that have disappeared include cancer, multiple sclerosis, Lupus, heart problems, Scleroderma, blindness and many more.</p><p></p><h2>The Architect Says: Quotes, Quips, and Words of Wisdom</h2><p>If there's anything architects like doing more than designing buildings, it's talking about architecture. Whether musing about their inspirations (a blank sheet of paper, the sun hitting the side of a building), expanding on each other's thoughts (on materials, collaboration, clients, and constraints), or dishing out a clever quip, architects make good copy. <em>The Architect Says</em> is a colorful compendium of quotations from more than one hundred of history's most opinionated design minds. Paired on page spreads like guests at a dinner party-an architect of today might sit next to a contemporary or someone from the eighteenth century-these sets of quotes convey a remarkable depth and diversity of thinking. Alternately wise and amusing, this elegant gem of a book makes the perfect gift for architects, students, and anyone curious about the ideas and personalities that have helped shape our built world.</p><p>"A pocketbook of inspiration.... Coming across unexpected quotes or ones that hit a nerve makes a flip through the book great. A couple of my favorites includes Jan Kaplicky: 'It's not a sign of creativity to have sixty-five ideas for one problem. It's just a waste of energy.' and Frank Gehry: 'I don't know why people hire architects and then tell them what to do.' These and other quotes make the book a great gift." -- Archidose.com<br><br>"When it's 4 am and you're sitting in a confused mess of crumpled trace paper and dull X-acto blades, turn to this trusty compilation and try to find the light." -- ArtInfo.com<br><br>"The Architect Says: Quotes, Quips, and Words of Wisdom gathers timeless wisdom on design and architecture from more than 100 of history's most vocal-and often dissenting-minds. What emerges, besides the fascinating tapas bar of ideas about the art and science of building, is the subtle but essential reminder that what lies at the heart of creative legacy aren't universal formulas and unrelenting tenets but perspective, conviction, and personality." -- Brain Pickings</p><h2>A Tired Woman&#39;s Guide to Passionate Sex: Reclaim Your Desire and Reignite Your Relationship</h2><p><b>The only book of its kind with several scientific studies showing that women who read it regain their desire, as well as improve their sexual satisfaction, arousal, lubrication, and rates of orgasm!</b><br><br>"Honey, I'm too tired" may sound like just another excuse but for millions of American women, it's simply the truth. They may settle for no sex at all or the obligatory "I'd better do this for my marriage" sex often to the detriment of their relationships. In this guide, Dr. Laurie Mintz shows women how to bring their libido back to life.<br><br>Mintz, a psychologist and sex expert, has been there, both personally and professionally. She shares her own story, as well as the stories of her many clients, as she puts forward her foolproof step-by-step guide to bring passion back into your life. Complete with case studies and exercises, this sex-cure-in-a-book will help readers feel sexy and sensual again!</p><p>Laurie B. Mintz, PhD (Columbia, MO) has both the personal and professional experience and knowledge to write this book. She is a tired woman who has regained her once-lost passion and a psychologist with more than fifteen years of experience helping countless women to do the same. She has a PhD in psychology and is a licensed psychologist with a wealth of experience counseling women and couples. Thanks to following her own advice, she enjoys a passionate and satisfying sexual relationship with her husband of twenty-two years.The most frequently heard presenting complaint in sex therapist offices, from both males and females, is inhibited sexual desire (ISD). And the most common explanation for low sex drive (LSD) is fatigue. I love this book because it is THE ONLY one that honestly deals with the causes of the exhaustion and provides positive suggestions to get back some, if not all, of the zing." (Sue Johanson, R.N, C.M., host of <i>Talk Sex with Sue</i>&nbsp;on Oxygen and Other Channels)<br>&nbsp;<br>As a sex therapist who has seen many couples and individual women complaining of lack of desire, I was curious as to whether Laurie Mintz's Tired Woman's Guide to Passionate Sex would be of value to my clients. In an organized, clear format, Mintz lays out the myriad of causes for their innate desire or libido, while providing many reasons why the path to regain it is worth it emotionally, medically and spiritually. Also included are tried-and-true techniques she has used in treatment to inspire a revitalization in her clients' sex lives. Mintz has written the book in a supportive, warm, authentic voice. I also appreciated her transparency in sharing her own personal journey in her introduction. Additionally, throughout the book, she has interspersed case examples from her practice which offer the reader scenarios with which they might identify. I would recommend this to clients. I would also offer it to a friend who repeats that so oft repeated line: "Sex? That is the last thing I'm thinking about these days. But I do miss what I used to feel like."

The advice in this book is easy to understand, the reasons for the techniques are compelling, and the anecdotes from women about their tiring lives and depleted sexual libidos will likely resonate with many readers.

A middle-aged woman is bouncing along on a bus in Buenos Aires, reading and reflecting on Psalm 1. A young Korean executive, on his way home to Seoul from a business trip in Singapore, flies above the clouds at 35,000 feet, reading and pondering the words of the apostle Paul in Romans 5. And in a dorm room in San Diego, California, a young college student polishes off another Mountain Dew and then looks back down at her lap-top computer to finish reading Mark&#x2019;s account of how Jesus miraculously calmed a raging storm on the Sea of Galilee.<br>People all over the world love reading the Bible&#x2014;and they have loved it for thousands of years. Why? People read the Bible because it is a fascinating book, filled with gripping stories and challenging exhortations. People read it because it is an important book, dealing with the big issues of life&#x2014;God, eternal life, death, love, sin, and morals. People read it because they believe that in the Bible God speaks to them through written words. The Bible encourages us, lifts our spirits, comforts us, guides us, chides us, builds us up, gives us hope, and brings us close to the living God.<br>Some parts of the Bible are easy to understand, but much of it is not. Most Christians, however, desire to understand all of God&#x2019;s Word, not just the easy portions. Many of us want to be able to dig deeper into that Word. We want to see more and to understand more of the biblical text. We also want to know that we understand the Bible correctly. That is, we want to be confident that we can pull the actual truth out of a text and not just develop an arbitrary, fanciful, or incorrect interpretation. Our book is designed for such people. The process of interpreting and grasping the Bible is similar to embarking on a journey. Reading the text thoroughly and carefully lies at the beginning of the journey. From this careful reading we become able to determine what the passage meant in the biblical context&#x2014;that is, what it meant to the biblical audience. Often, however, when we try to apply this meaning directly to ourselves, we run into problems. We are separated from the biblical audience by culture and customs, language, situation, and a vast expanse of time. These differences form a barrier&#x2014;a river that separates us from the text and that often prohibits us from grasping the meaning of the text for ourselves. If that were not enough, the Old Testament widens the river by adding another major interpretive barrier that separates us from the audience. Between the Old Testament biblical audience and Christian readers today lies a change in covenant. We as New Testament believers are under the new covenant, and we approach God through the sacrifice of Christ. The Old Testament people, however, were under the old covenant, and for them the law was central. In other words, the theological situation for the two groups is different. There is a covenant barrier between the Old Testament audience and us because we are under different covenants.<br>Thus, the river between the Old Testament text and us consists not only of culture, language, situation, and time, but also of covenant. We have much more in common with the New Testament audience; yet even in the New Testament, the different culture, language, and specific situations can present a formidable barrier to our desire to grasp the meaning of the text. The river is often too deep and too wide simply to wade across.<br>As a result, today&#x2019;s Christian is often uncertain about how to interpret much of the Bible. How should we understand Leviticus 19:19, which prohibits wearing a garment made of two types of material? Does this mean that obedient Christians should wear only 100 percent cotton clothes? In Judges 6:37 Gideon puts out a fleece in order to confirm what God had told him. Does this mean that we should put out fleeces when we seek God&#x2019;s leading? Passages in the New Testament are not always much clearer. For example, Peter walks on the water in Matthew 14:29. Does this mean that we should attempt to walk on water in our obedience to Christ? If not, what does it mean and how can we apply it to our lives today? Even if we cannot walk on water, how do we cross the river that separates us from the text?<br>Any attempt to interpret and to apply the Bible involves trying to cross the river. While often unconscious of their interpretive method, many Christians today nonetheless frequently employ an intuitive or feels-right approach to interpretation. If the text looks as if it could be applied directly, then they attempt to apply it directly. If not, then they take a spiritualizing approach to the meaning&#x2014;an approach that borders on allegorizing the biblical text (which shows little or no sensitivity to the biblical context). Or else they simply shrug their shoulders and move on to another passage, ignoring the meaning of the text altogether.<br>Such approaches will never land us safely on the other side of the river. Those using the intuitive approach blindly wade out into the river, hoping that the water is not more than knee deep. Sometimes they are fortunate and stumble on to a sandbar, but often they step out into deep water, and they end up washed ashore somewhere downstream. Those who spiritualize, by contrast, try to jump the river in one grand leap, but they also end up washed ashore downstream with their intuitive buddies. Shrugging or ignoring a passage is to remain on the far side of the river and simply to gaze across without even attempting to cross.</p><h2>A Slice of Heaven (A Sweet Magnolias Novel)</h2><p><p>Emotions run high when the Sweet Magnolias try to reunite a couple who was meant to be together in this classic from #1 New York Times bestselling author Sherryl Woods&nbsp;</p><p>When an eating disorder threatens the life of chef Dana Sue Sullivan's teenage daughter, she has no choice but to bring Annie's cheating dad back to Serenity, South Carolina. She tells herself and her friends it's all about Annie, but the sad truth is she has a boatload of unresolved feelings of her own for Ronnie Sullivan. &nbsp;</p><p>From the moment Ronnie hits town, there's no question about his intentions. He's there for his daughter, to be sure, but he wants Dana Sue back, and every move he makes is designed to prove he's a changed man. The one thing that's never changed, though, are the sparks that fly whenever the two of them are in the same room.&nbsp;</p><p>Dana Sue can deny all she wants that Ronnie's the only man for her, but not a single person in town is buying it. No matter the circumstances, Ronnie's return is a sweet recipe for a new beginning.</p></p><p>Dana Sue might run the best little restaurant in Serenity, but when you're feeding a small town of neighbors, busybodies and best friends, things can get a bit hot in the kitchen. Never mind that she's putting on too many pounds (an occupational hazard for a chef)&#x2014;she's worried about her too-skinny teenage daughter, Annie, who has been slowly starving herself since the loud, suitcase-tossing, name-calling fit on her front lawn that left Dana Sue minus one cheating husband. But sometimes life picks strange ways to mend fences. When Annie lands in the hospital, Dana Sue reaches out to the man she loves to hate: Ron, the husband who took her heart when she tossed him out. Ron is still Annie's white knight, even if he's decidedly more tarnished in Dana Sue's eyes. But he still looks good enough to eat, and maybe, just maybe, to forgive. Once, Ron made the mistake of letting go without a proper fight. But now Dana Sue is about to get another taste of sweet devotion from a man tired of feeling like a fool, hungry for that slice of heaven he found with her.<p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina.

Winter had been steady and predictable, but it was quite poked through now, and spring was peeking out from underneath it. The world was ready for a change. The people of Ferenwood were excited for spring, but this was to be expected; they had always been fond of predictable, reliable sorts of changes, like night turning into day and rain turning into snow. They didn&#x2019;t much care for night turning into cake or rain turning into shoelaces, because that wouldn&#x2019;t make sense, and making sense was terribly important to these people who&#x2019;d built their lives around magic. And squint as they might, it was very difficult for them to make any sense of Alice.</p><p>Alice was a young girl and, naturally, she was all the things you&#x2019;d expect a young girl to be: smart and lively and passionate about any number of critical issues. But Alice was also lacking a great deal of something important, and it was this&#x2014;her lack of something important&#x2014;that made her so interesting, and so very unusual. More on that soon.</p><p>***</p><p>The afternoon our story begins, the quiet parts of being alive were the busiest: wind unlocking windows; rainlight nudging curtains apart; fresh-cut grass tickling unsocked feet.&nbsp;Days like this made Alice want to set off on a great adventure, and&#x2014;at almost twelve years old&#x2014;she&#x2019;d very nearly figured out how to fashion one together. The annual Surrender was only a single pair of days away, and Alice&#x2014;who was determined to win&#x2014;knew it was her chance to set sail for something new.</p><p>She was on her way home now, occasionally peeking over her shoulder at the glittering town in the distance. The village square was undergoing no small transformation in honor of the upcoming festivities, and the clamor of instruction and construction rang out across the hills. Alice jumped from flagstone to flagstone, her face caught in the rainlight glow, her hands grasping for a touch of gold. The town&#x2019;s excitement was contagious, and the air was so thick with promise Alice could almost bite into it. She smiled, cheeks appled in delight, and stared up at the sky. The light was beginning to spark and fade, and the clouds were still hard at work weaving together, breaking and building as they had been all week. One more day of this, Alice thought, and everything would change.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t wait.</p><p>She&#x2019;d moved on to the main road now, a dirt path flanked by green. She held tight to her basket as neighbors passed, nodding hello and waving good-bye, happy to have remembered her clothes today. Mother was always bothering her about that.</p><p>Alice plucked a tulip from her pocket and bit off the top. She felt the petals pressing against her tongue; she could taste the velvet, the magenta of it all. She closed her eyes and licked her lips before biting into the stem. Not quite green but brighter, more vibrant; there was a song in that color and she could feel it singing inside of her. She bent down to greet a blade of grass and whispered,Hello, me too, me too, we&#x2019;re still alive.</p><p>Alice was an odd girl, even for Ferenwood, where the sun occasionally rained and the colors were brighter than usual and magic was as common as a frowning parent. Her oddness was evident even in the simplest things she did, though most especially in her inability to walk home in a straight line. She stopped too many times, wandering off the main path, catching deep breaths and holding them, too selfish to let them go. She spun until her skirts circled around her, smiling so wide she thought her face would break and blossom. She hopped around on tiptoe, and only when she could stand it no longer would she exhale what wasn&#x2019;t hers to keep.</p><p>Alice would grow up to be a wildflower, Father once said to her. A wildflower in flowing skirts, braided hair dancing from head to knee. She&#x2019;d always hoped that he was right, that maybe Mother had gotten it wrong, that Alice was never meant to be such a complicated thing with all these limbs and needs. She often wanted to plant herself back into the earth to see if she&#x2019;d grow into something better this time, maybe a dandelion or an oak tree or a walnut no one could crack. But Mother insisted (the way she often did) that Alice must be a girl, and so she was.</p><p>Alice didn&#x2019;t like Mother very much. She found her a bit old and confusing, and didn&#x2019;t like the way Mother worried about walls and doors and the money that put them there. But Alice loved Mother, too, in the way that children did. Mother was soft and warm, and Mother&#x2019;s smiles came easily when she looked at Alice. Anger and tears, too, but those Alice never cared for.</p><p>Alice gripped her basket tighter and danced down the road to a song she found in her ear; her toes warmed the earth, and her hair, too heavy for her head, tried to keep up. Her bangles mimicked the rain, simple melodies colliding in the space between elbows and wrists. She closed her eyes. She knew this dance the way she knew her own name; its syllables found her, rolled off her hips with an intimacy that could not be taught.</p><p>This was her skill, her talent, her great gift to Ferenwood. It was her ticket to greatness. She&#x2019;d been practicing for years and years and was determined that it would not be for nothing.</p><p>It would not b&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey there! What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice startled. Something tripped and fell, and she looked around in dismay to realize it had been her. Crumpled skirts and silent bangles, the rainlight gone from the sky. She was late. Mother would be upset again.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; The same voice as before. &#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Alice gathered her skirts and fumbled in the dark for her basket, reaching blindly as panic set in. Don&#x2019;t talk to strangers, Mother had always said&#x2014;especially strange men.Being afraid meant it was okay to forget your manners. If you&#x2019;re afraid, you never have to be nice. Do you understand?</p><p>Alice had nodded.</p><p>And now Mother was not here and she could not explain why, exactly, but Alice was afraid. So she did not feel the need to be nice.</p><p>The stranger wasn&#x2019;t much of a man at all, it turned out. More like a boy. Alice wanted to tell him very firmly to go away, but she&#x2019;d somehow gotten it into her head that being quiet meant being invisible and so she prayed that her silence would somehow make him blind, instead of louder.</p><p>Unfortunately, her wish seemed to work on both of them.</p><p>The sun had folded itself away and the moon was in no hurry to replace it. Darkness engulfed her. Alice&#x2019;s basket was nowhere to be felt or found.</p><p>She was very worried.</p><p>Suddenly Alice understood all about being worried and she promised herself she would never judge Mother for being worried all the time. Suddenly she understood that it is a very hard thing, to be afraid of things, and that it takes up so much time. Suddenly she understood why Mother rarely got around to doing the dishes.</p><p>&#x201c;Does this belong to you?&#x201d;</p><p>Alice turned just a bit and found a chest in her face. There was a chest in her face and a heart in that chest and it was beating quite hard. She could hear the pitters, the patters&#x2014;the blood rushing around in ebbs and flows.Don&#x2019;t be distracted, she told herself, begged herself. Think of Mother.</p><p>But, oh.</p><p>What a heart.</p><p>What a symphony inside that body.</p><p>Alice gasped.</p><p>He&#x2019;d touched her arm, so, really, she had no choice but to punch him. Her bangles were helpful in this regard. She punched and kicked and screamed a little and she wrenched her basket from his hands and she ran all the way home, out of breath and a little excited, so glad the moon had finally decided to join her.</p><p>***</p><p>Alice never did get to tell Mother her story.</p><p>Mother was so upset Alice was late that she nearly bit off her daughter&#x2019;s hands. She didn&#x2019;t give Alice a chance to explainwhy her skirts were dirty or why the basket had broken (only a little bit, really) orwhy her hair was so full of grass. Mother made a terrible face and pointed to a chair at the table and told Alice that if she was late one more time she would knot her fingers together. Again.</p><p>Oh, Mother was always threatening her.</p><p>Threatening made Mother feel better but made Alice feel bored. Alice usually ignored Mother&#x2019;s threats (If you don&#x2019;t eat your breakfast I will whisk you into an elephant,she once said to her, and Alice half hoped she really would), but then one time Alice took her clothes off at the dinner table and Mother threatened to turn her into aboy, and that scared her so dizzy that Alice kept on her outerthings for a whole week after that. Since then, Alice had often wondered whether her brothers had been boys to begin with, or whether they&#x2019;d just been naughty enough to deserve being tricked into it.</p><p>***</p><p>Mother was unpacking Alice&#x2019;s basket very carefully, paying far more attention to its contents than to any of her four children sitting at the worn kitchen table. Alice ran her hands along its weathered top, the bare boards rubbed smooth from years of use. Father had made this table himself, and Alice often pretended she could remember the day he built it. That was silly of course; Father had built it long before she was born.</p><p>She glanced toward his place at the table. His chair was empty&#x2014;as it had grown accustomed to being&#x2014;and Alice dropped her head, because sadness had left hinges in her bones. With some effort she managed to look up again, and when she did, she found her brothers, whose small forms took up the three remaining chairs, staring at her expectantly, as though she might turn their tunics into turnips. On any other occasion she would&#x2019;ve liked to, had she been so inclined, but Mother was already quite mad and Alice did not want to sleep with the pigs tonight.</p><p>Alice was beginning to realize that while she didn&#x2019;t much like Mother, Mother didn&#x2019;t much like her, either. Mother didn&#x2019;t care for the oddness of Alice; she wasn&#x2019;t a parent who was predisposed to liking her children. She didn&#x2019;t find their quirks endearing. She thought Alice was a perfectly functional, occasionally absurd child, but on an honest afternoon Mother would tell you that she didn&#x2019;t care for children, never had, not really, but here they were. (There were plenty of nice things Mother had said about Alice, too, but Mother was never very good at making sure she said those things out loud.)</p><p>Alice picked out a blossom from her dinner and dropped it on her tongue, rolling the taste of it around in her mouth. She loved blossoms; one bite and she felt refreshed, ready to begin again. Mother liked dipping them in honey, but Alice preferred the unmasked taste. Alice liked truth: on her lips and in her mouth.</p><p>The kitchen was warm and cozy, but only halfheartedly. Alice and Mother did their best in the wake of Father&#x2019;s absence, but some evenings all the unspoken hurts piled high on their plates and they ate sorrow with their syrup without saying a word about it. Tonight wasn&#x2019;t so bad. Tonight the stove glowed lavender as Mother stoked the flames and tossed in some of the berries Alice had collected. Soon the whole house smelled of warm figs and peppermints and Alice was certain that if she tried, she could lick the air right out of the room. Mother was smiling, finally content. Ferenberries always succeeded in reminding Mother of happier times with Father, of days long ago when all was safe and all was good. The berries were a rare treat for those lucky enough to find them (they were a fruit especially difficult to procure), but in Father&#x2019;s absence Mother had become obsessed. The trouble was, she needed Alice to find the ferenberries (I&#x2019;ll explain why later), and Alice always did, because life at home had been so much better since the berries. Alice had been late and she&#x2019;d been lazy, messy and argumentative, but she had never not come home with the berries.</p><p>She almost hadn&#x2019;t tonight.</p><p>Alice always felt Mother was using her for the berries; she knew they were the only medicine that helped Mother&#x2019;s heart in Father&#x2019;s absence. Alice knew Mother needed her, but she did not feel appreciated; and though she felt sad for Mother, she felt more sorry than sad. She wanted Mother to grow up&#x2014;or maybe grow down&#x2014;into the mother she and her brothers really needed. But Mother could not unbecome herself, so Alice was resigned to loving and disliking her just as she was, for as long as she could bear it. Soon, Alice thought, very soon, she would be on her way to something better. Something bigger. The seasons were changing in Ferenwood, and Alice had waited long enough.</p><p>She would win the Surrender and she would show Mother she could make her own way in the world and she would never need a pair of stockings again. She would be an explorer! An inventor!&nbsp;No&#x2014;a painter! She would capture the world with a few broad strokes!&nbsp;Her hand moved of its own accord, making shapes in her honey-laden plate. Her arm flew up in a moment of triumph and her paintbrush fork flew from her hands only to land, quite elegantly, in her brother&#x2019;s hair.</p><p>Alice ducked down in her chair, the future forgotten, as Mother came at her with a ladle.</p><p>Oh, she would be sleeping with the pigs tonight.</p></p><h2>Criminal Psychology: Understanding the Criminal Mind and Its Nature Through Criminal Profiling</h2><p><p><b>The Secrets Behind The Criminal Psychology Is Finally Revealed and Understood! and You Can Get To Know Them Today!</b></p> $9.97 only today!

Why do we often live as though the gospel stops at the moment of conversion?&nbsp;The good news of Jesus doesn&#x2019;t stop the moment we get saved. In fact, salvation is only the beginning of God&#x2019;s work in our lives. We often view salvation as the ending point; it&#x2019;s really the beginning point. The gospel of Jesus doesn&#x2019;t only justify us; it sanctifies us. When we receive the Holy Spirit at salvation, an incredible work begins to happen in us: we begin to bear fruit. When we are firmly planted in the gospel and committed to growing in Christ, He produces in us the fruits of the Spirit, the marks of a true Christian.&nbsp;In <i>Bearing Fruit</i>, Robby Gallaty walks us through the life of the Christian. Biblical, intentional, and practical, <i>Bearing Fruit</i> points our hearts to the gracious God who called us, justified us, and is now sanctifying us by the work of his Holy Spirit.</p><p><b>Robby Gallaty</b> is the Senior Pastor of Long Hollow Baptist Church in Hendersonville, TN.

He is as real as a tree, a cloud, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the wind. But when the two are accidentally separated, no one in Henry&#x2019;s&nbsp;family believes Leo is real enough to find his way home. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With beautiful mixed-media paintings, the Caldecott Honor&#x2013;winning artist Pamela Zagarenski explores the transcendent nature of friendship and love.</p><p><b>Pamela Zagarenski </b>is the winner of two Caldecott Honors.

Visit her online at pzagarenski.com, on Instagram&nbsp;@sacredbee, and Twitter&nbsp;@sacredbeez.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;In this spare picture book, Zagarenski explores the familiar theme of a stuffed animal becoming real. Leo, a stuffed toy lion, is Henry's favorite. Henry has other toys, for sure, such as a bear, bunny, and fox. But Leo is special, with his glass button eyes and jointed and movable parts, and he and Henry are inseparable. One day the family decides to go for a walk in the woods, and Henry excitedly declares, "Leo loves the woods!" Henry's disbelieving sister scolds him, though, saying, "Leo is a stuffed toy, and toys aren't real!" Henry knows better as they enjoy a stroll through the Nearby Woods. Unfortunately, after a long, tiring walk, Leo is accidentally left behind. Heading out again into the night, the family searches, but the little friend is nowhere to be found. Henry is inconsolable as he lies in bed, but magic is happening in the Nearby Woods. Henry's stuffed toys transform into real animals, and the bear, the rabbit, and the fox guide Leo safely home. The next morning, the family finds him in the garden, looking every bit like a stuffed animal again. However, Leo quietly whispers a real "I love you" into Henry's ear. The full-bleed illustrations are done in mixed media and have a soft, dreamy quality to them. As the people and toys drift between the real world and the magical one, ghostly crowns appear over their heads. The nighttime scenes in the forest contain fantasylike elements, contrasting with the more realistic ones in the real world. VERDICT The stunning, sumptuous artwork and familiar themes make this a serene and satisfying bedtime story for young children, with just the right amount of dramatic tension.&#x2014;Roxanne Burg, Orange County Public Library, CA</p><h2>Spirit in Session: Working with Your Client&#x2019;s Spirituality (and Your Own) in Psychotherapy (Spirituality and Mental Health)</h2><p><p>Spirituality is an important part of many clients&#x2019; lives. It can be a resource for stabilization, healing, and growth. It can also be the cause of struggle and even harm. More and more therapists&#x2014;those who consider themselves spiritual and those who do not&#x2014;recognize the value of addressing spirituality in therapy and increasing their skill for engaging it ethically and effectively.<br><br> In this immensely practical book, Russell Siler Jones helps therapists feel more competent and confident about having spiritual conversations with clients. With a refreshing, down-to-earth style, he describes how to recognize the diverse explicit and implicit ways spirituality can appear in psychotherapy, how to assess the impact spirituality is having on clients, how to make interventions to maximize its healthy impact and lessen its unhealthy impact, and how therapists can draw upon their own spirituality in ethical and skillful ways. He includes extended case studies and clinical dialogue so readers can hear how spirituality becomes part of case conceptualization and what spiritual conversation actually sounds like in psychotherapy.<br><br> Jones has been a therapist for nearly 30 years and has trained therapists in the use of spirituality for over a decade.

He simply cannot resist the urge to dress up in clothes left over from his vaudeville days--complete with top hat and gold-headed cane--and to perform tricks, play banjo and tell jokes. He taps, twirls and laughs himself to tears on a thrown-together stage in his attic. Artist Stephen Gammell takes full advantage of lamplight to render Grandpa in shadow and silhouette, trivializing the concept of age and creating a feeling of intense nostalgia. Related from the point of view of the children, the text in Song and Dance Man is soft and understated, and Gammell&#39;s artistry is superb.

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at <i>The Source, </i>he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.<br><br>Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation&#x2014;and career&#x2014;of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.<br><br>Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police. So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help. It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.<br><br>Then tragedy occurs and New Scotland Yard becomes involved. Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley soon discovers that the case sends tentacles from London into the countryside, and he must simultaneously outfox death as he probes Charlotte Bowen's mysterious disappearance.

Developed from the popular Lion Rampant system, Dragon Rampant is a standalone wargame that recreates the great battles of Fantasy fiction. Scenarios, army lists, and full rules for magic and monsters give players the opportunity to command unruly orc warbands, raise armies of the undead, campaign across an antediluvian world as the warchief of a barbarian tribe, or exploit the power of mighty creatures and extraordinary sorcery. An army usually consists of 6-8 units comprised of 6-12 individually based figures. These small units move and fight independently, assuming that they follow your orders rather than just doing their own thing. Command and control is just as important on the battlefield as the power of a troll chieftain or the magic of an archmage.</p><p>Daniel Mersey has spent three decades leading miniature armies to spectacular defeat on ancient, medieval, and colonial battlefields.

The work is divided into two parts: Book One: Design &amp; History, and Book Two: Geometry &amp; Joinery Systems.Book One begins with The Elements of Design. In this section, Chappell draws parallels between the significance of proper design proportions, harmonics and the feel that resonates between these elements and the craftsman's touch. Through the proportions of the golden mean, phi and the Fibonacci sequence, metaphors to music and the jazz of timber framing, Chappell begins to develop a design template that includes both sound and harmonic resonance as fundamental aspects of the design medium.In A Brief History of Roof Framing, Chappell then goes on to explore the early development and history of timber framed roof systems from the 12th century Stave Churches, medieval Tithe Barns and Market halls of Europe, to the ancient Pagodas of China and Japan. The focus is on discovering how and why the systems and techniques used to build vernacular medieval timber framed roof systems evolved on a regional basis.Book Two moves into the technical aspects of how to begin the process by first Developing the Geometric Model. Though the subject can be quite complex, the emphasis on developing a strong visual mental image at the outset is strengthened through the use of numerous photographs and illustrations. In The Vocabulary of Compound Joinery, the book goes on to thoroughly discuss a very broad variety of design options and joinery details for virtually any situation one may ever confront in constructing complex, joined timber framed roof systems.Chappell presents a complete and comprehensive geometric and mathematical system in this work. One that can be used to design virtually any conceivable arrangement of complex structural members that one may ever face&#x2014;all using mortise and tenon joinery.Steve Chappell has been building, teaching and writing about timber framing and traditional building for more than 35 years. He is an early pioneer of the timber framing revival, and one of the co-founders of the Timber Framers Guild in 1984. As the founder and director of Fox Maple School of Traditional Building in 1983, Chappell has taught many hundreds of students the finer aspects of timber framing, and has been a prominent and enthusiastic advocate of traditional timber framing and natural building systems. As the publisher and editor of <i>Joiners' Quarterly</i> for many years, Chappell has written extensively on the subject of traditional building, and is also the author of the book, <i>A Timber Framers Workshop.</i></p><h2>The Dorm Room Diet: The 10-Step Program for Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Plan That Really Works</h2><p><p>The 10-Step Program for Creating a Healthy Lifestyle Plan That Really Works</p><p><em>The Dorm Room Diet</em></p><p>Revised and Updated Edition</p><p>Figuring out how to eat right and stay healthy on your own can be hard!

She has gained entrance to the most pained, secret chambers in the hearts of Chinese mothers&#x2014;students, successful businesswomen, midwives, peasants&#x2014;who, whether as a consequence of the single-child policy, destructive age-old traditions, or hideous economic necessity, have given up their daughters. Xinran beautifully portrays the &#x201c;extra-birth guerrillas&#x201d; who travel the roads and the railways, evading the system, trying to hold on to more than one baby; na�ve young girl students who have made life-wrecking mistakes; the &#x201c;pebble mother&#x201d; on the banks of the Yangtze River still looking into the depths for her stolen daughter; peasant women rejected by their families because they can&#x2019;t produce a male heir; and Little Snow, the orphaned baby fostered by Xinran but confiscated by the state. <br><br>For parents of adopted Chinese children and for the children themselves, this is an indispensable, powerful, and intensely moving book. Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother is powered by love and by heartbreak and will stay with readers long after they have turned the final page.</p><p><b>Xinran </b>was born in Beijing in 1958 and was a successful journalist and radio presenter in China. In 1997 she moved to London, where she began work on her seminal book about Chinese women&#x2019;s lives, <i>The Good Women of China</i>. Since then she has written a regular column for the <i>Guardian</i>, appeared frequently on radio and television and published the acclaimed <i>Sky Burial </i>and a book of her <i>Guardian </i>columns called <i>What the Chinese Don't Eat</i>. She lives in London but travels regularly to China.<b> <b>A BOOK WRITTEN <br>FOR ADOPTED DAUGHTERS</b> <br> </b> <br> <br>It took a long time for me to summon the courage to relive the personal memories and experiences of my life as a reporter in China. In <i>The Good Women of China</i>, my first book, published in 2002, I wrote about those brave women who had told me their stories when I worked as a radio presenter. But there were some stories I could not yet bring myself to tell. They were too painful and too close to home. I am not a particularly courageous woman; I am just a woman who longs to feel a mother&#x2019;s embrace and that lifelong bond of love and dependence between mother and daughter. Little by little, that longing seeped through me until it began to dominate my thoughts night and day. Reawakening the memories threatened to reopen old wounds: I would miss my own mother more than ever and would feel even more bitterness that I would never have that kind of love.<br> <br>At a talk I gave at the International Book Fair in Melbourne, Australia, in 2002, someone asked me, &#x201c;Xinran, what is your dream?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t even have to think about the answer. I said, &#x201c;To be a daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was uproar from the audience of several hundred people. &#x201c;But you were born, so you must be someone&#x2019;s daughter!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In a biological sense, yes,&#x201d; I responded. &#x201c;But I was born into a traditional culture, I experienced brutal political upheavals as a child, and my mother and I lived in times that did not consider bonds of family affection important. The result is there&#x2019;s not a single occasion I can remember when my mother said she loved me, or even hugged me.&#x201d;<br> <br>After the meeting, I found a line of silver-haired women waiting for me by the car. They were there, they said, to give me a mother&#x2019;s embrace. One by one they came up to me, put their arms around me, and kissed my forehead. ...<br> <br>I could not help myself, tears poured down my face. In my heart, I cried, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful for their genuine affection, but how I wish my own mother could have held me like this. Every day, since I was a little girl, I have missed my mother&#x2019;s love so much!&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1958, when I was just thirty days old, I was sent away to live with my grandmother. Like millions of Chinese women, my mother believed that anyone who put their family and children before their country and the Party was at best selfish and at worst criminal.<br> <br>My earliest memory of my mother is of her walking toward me on a very quiet platform in the Nanjing railway station. She was a cloud of purple&#x2014;her silk scarf draped over her shoulders waved in the breeze. She smiled sweetly and opened her arms to me like a dancer on the stage.<br> <br>I was five years old and had never called anyone mother before. That day, at my grandmother&#x2019;s urging, I called my mother &#x201c;aunty&#x201d;&#x2014;what children call any female stranger in China&#x2014;and as I whispered the word this beautiful woman stiffened and a solitary tear fell down her face.<br> <br>In 1966, only two weeks after I had begun living with my mother, the Cultural Revolution began. My parents were both sent to a political jail within a month of each other. My younger brother, who was only two and a half, and I became orphans. Ten years later we were all back as one family but no one has ever spoken about how we survived the struggles during that turbulent time.<br> <br>In 1989, after twelve years of studying and working at a military university, I became a radio presenter. The first time I went to a small village in the countryside, I was devastated by the poverty-stricken lives I witnessed. It was only a forty-minute drive from the city I worked in, but they were so poor that in the summer most children did not even wear trousers, they only had a pair to provide warmth in the winter. I was so shocked to hear from the people I interviewed, face-to-face, the real numbers on how many lives had been lost in the past one hundred years within China. I was so ashamed by my lack of knowledge of traditional Chinese culture and the real history of China.<br> <br>Until then, I never realized how ignorant I was about the real China and how misguided I was in my education about my mother&#x2019;s and grandmother&#x2019;s generations, so I started to reeducate myself by learning the truth from people. I went on a journey to find out the answers to my bewildering questions from my country and my people. Over the next eight years, I traveled around and met more than two hundred Chinese women for my radio program. I listened to them, and their stories struck a chord deep within me. I found myself as one of them&#x2014;as a daughter, our lives watered down by the tears from our past.<br> <br>I moved to London in 1997. After eight years of digging, searching, and feeling for Chinese women, I felt empty and run-down. During my time as a radio presenter I had received about a hundred letters every day with personal secrets full of dreams and confusion, and I had witnessed my country jumping onto a rapidly moving express train toward the Western lights, but the people still lacked the necessary education to grasp the massive force of change that was sweeping across the country. Therefore, as a Chinese woman who had walked a long march to find out who I am, I chose to start afresh in London, where I could deepen my understanding of the world.<br> <br>But once there, I was stunned and hurt by how little Westerners understood the Chinese people. And on my many trips back to China I discovered how little the younger Chinese understood about their parents&#x2019; generation. I found that our children have been cut off from the real history and even from their own family history. They have no idea about what kind of life their mothers and grandmothers have endured; they don&#x2019;t even believe that they have love stories.<br> <br>Then one day in 1998, while I was teaching at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, an Italian student came to me with a book he had been reading and asked me, &#x201c;Is it true that Chinese women physically lack emotional cells and are mentally short of love as described in this book?&#x201d; I was flabbergasted. Finally, through gritted teeth, I told him, &#x201c;I am going to write a book that will move this world to tears about the Chinese women I know, on their rich feeling, their deep love and unconditional giving.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since I began writing books about the lives of Chinese women, I have been fortunate enough to receive countless letters, photographs, and videos from adopted Chinese girls and the adopting families from all over the world. Their letters, like the two that follow (and the others on p. 187 and pp. 195&#x2013;199), bring me comfort, and it is with their encouragement that I have finally managed to write down the stories of Chinese women who were forced to abandon their babies.<br> <br><i>Dear Xinran</i>,<br> <br><i>I am the (adoptive) mother of two beautiful daughters of China. My daughters are now 11 and 9. They both are very happy in our family and much loved. They also will never forget they have a birth family in China. They love their birth mothers and both of them, like you, would very much like to see their birth mother&#x2019;s face and hear her words. Please write your book. In this way they will know the heart of their birth mothers. Though we have told them we will look for their birth mothers if they desire to find them, we have also told them such a search may not be successful. The message you send from birth mothers may be all they ever have of their Chinese family</i>.<br> <br><i>One thing you can tell the Chinese birth mothers is that their daughters have not forgotten them. In our family their birth mothers are honored. My daughters and I study Pu Tong Hua. We have already returned to China 2 times with our daughters. They love the land of their birth, as their father and I do. We are proud to be an American Chinese family</i>.<br> <br><i>Please send our love, gratitude, and honor to their Chinese mothers</i>.<br> <br> <i>Thank you,</i> <br> <br> <i>The Macechko Family</i> <br> <br> <i>(USA)</i> <br> <br><i>Dear Xinran</i>,<br> <br> <i>So lovely to hear from you. I know just what you mean about how it takes days for your &#x201c;head&#x201d; to arrive back after your body. Flying around the world is such an odd experience in that way. Please, please, please do write Messages from Chinese Mums. You have to write it for all those girls. Mei and Xue even now ask why their &#x201c;tummy mummy&#x201d; couldn&#x2019;t look after them. I have to say, I don&#x2019;t know. Because I do not know. I can&#x2019;t lie. I can only guess&#x2014;maybe poverty, maybe postnatal depression, maybe rape, maybe the fact that they are girls, maybe she was a teenager?</i> <br> <br><i>I can only guess at the pain. I save all books and newspaper clippings of China, so that when the girls are big, they can read what life was like and try and understand&#x2014;maybe understand what their birth mother experienced. But, if you wrote some stories of the Chinese mothers, it would be more clearly explained</i>.<br> <br><i>I couldn&#x2019;t read</i> The Good Women of China <i>because I found it too painful. I cried and cried and cried. Each woman I thought of as Mei and Xue&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;and what she had to bear and what loss for her to leave her babies. Some day all those adopted girls have to understand that their mothers gave them up&#x2014;(HOPEFULLY) not because she didn&#x2019;t love them, but because life was too hard and too painful to bear. They must understand this fully. This is the only way to heal the pain for them of being rejected in that way</i>.<br> <br><i>Mei and Xue have brought such joy to our lives. Barry and I are complete with them and our family is a tight, beautiful bond. But I am aware that somewhere there is a mother (if she is alive) who has a deep pain about her girls. I want her to know that the girls are alive and happy and for her not to worry. But I also know that life is very complex and a well-intentioned Westerner can cause many problems easily</i>.<br> <br><i>I understand fully about MBL. It is very important. The link between all those girls and their mothers. The link between women of the world is very important. For some, your books are just stories, but for many of us, they are much more than that. Someday Mei and Xue will read your books and understand a little about their birth mum&#x2019;s life and those of their birth grandmothers. We can only thank you for that</i>.<br> <br> <i>...</i> <br> <br><i>With big hugs, Xinran (Mei and Xue send them also). They are fascinated by you&#x2014;Xue is very literary and loves the idea that you write books. She had me read out your email (I read out bits). Both girls sense some link with you. It is very interesting. Do come back and see us and come and stay when you are next over</i>.<br> <br> <i>With love, Ros</i> <br> <br> <i>(New Zealand)</i> <br> <br>These letters pour in. They haunt me and make me wonder: if I were an adopted daughter, where would I find answers to my inevitable questions about my strange start in life? In truth, I have been asking similar questions my whole life. I have tried so hard to forge a connection with my mother: I wish I could have known what happened to her during the ten years that she was missing from my life. I have dreamed of asking her if she knows what happened to me and my brother when she wasn&#x2019;t there. We had no right to play, to speak; we had no one to protect us from the Red Guards&#x2019; violence and abuse. Mum, do you know all of this? But I never dared ask her.<br> <br>I have tried to heal, to make myself a woman with a happy smile each day, but I can&#x2019;t control myself in the night&#x2014;lonely fears wake me up again and again. I don&#x2019;t want to recall missing my mother, but the ache never dulls. And that is why I was afraid to dredge up these things that have cost me so many tears and why I was afraid to write about the women who abandoned their daughters. But it is also why I must tell their stories.<br> <br>In December 2009, after I had finished editing this book, I returned to China and tried once more to confront my mother. I wanted to unburden myself of long-buried memories; I wanted to tell her what had happened to me, her daughter, during the Cultural Revolution. I wanted her to understand the nightmarish torments I went through, and which still haunt me. For her to know how much I missed her and still long for her, my mother. But I could not get a word out. I just sat silently in front of her, in floods of tears.<br> <br>Over the years I have begun to understand how those adopted daughters long to understand their birth mothers and to tell them how much they love them. I decided that, no matter how painful it was, I would write down the stories I had stored up for so long. This book was to be an honest record of mothers&#x2019; lives, a gift of mother-daughter love that I, a daughter, could share with other daughters, a message from an unknown Chinese mother to her daughter, wherever she may be.<br> <br>I started writing this book on February 2, 2008, in a little house by the sea on Blues Point Road, Sydney, Australia. Strangely, my labors were accompanied by a fortnight of the violent storms that a southern hemisphere summer sometimes brings.<br> <br>February 7, 2008, was the Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, and the Australian media reported on the tens of thousands of Chinese who joined in the cultural festivities. Among them were more than a hundred families who had adopted Chinese children. As I watched these girls dressed in Chinese costumes asking their Australian parents in English what the Spring Festival was, I had mixed feelings. Were these girls really China&#x2019;s daughters?<br> <br>Yes, I think they were. As the ancients said: when oranges from the south were transplanted to the north, they were still oranges, even if they tasted a bit different. I believe that even though these girls have been brought up in a foreign land and a foreign culture, the blood of their Chinese mothers still runs in their veins.<br> <br>But what do their birth mothers feel? Does the unknown Chinese mother feel joy or sorrow at knowing that her beloved daughter is now happy in another mother&#x2019;s arms? I did not actually give birth to a daughter, nor am I the mother of an adopted daughter, but I weep every time I try to imagine how they feel. And once I lost a little girl who was like a daughter to me, so I know something of what they feel. There is an emptiness that can never be filled, there is an ache felt by the broken-hearted birth mother, by the adoptive family in the West, and by the daughter who will spend the rest of her life in a dual embrace&#x2014;because the life she lives is a product of great joy but also of great sorrow.<br> <br>By the end of 2010, the number of Chinese orphans adopted worldwide had reached more than 120,000. America has the largest number of adopted Chinese children from China, nearly 80,000.* These children have gone to twenty-seven countries&#x2014;and almost all were girls. Most Chinese find the adoption figures almost incredible, just as they find it hard to believe that Chinese children have found mothers and homes in so many countries. Why does China have so many orphaned girls?<br> <br>Most Chinese would say that it is because there is something inherently wrong with traditional culture; in other words, old customs are rooted in ignorance. Westerners, on the other hand, believe that the one-child policy is to blame.

Side-splittingly funny and profoundly moving, <em>Drunk, Divorced, and Covered in Cat Hair</em> is the true-life misadventures of Laurie Perry, aka Crazy Aunt Purl, a slightly neurotic, displaced Southerner trying to create a new life after her husband leaves her to 'get his creativity back.' (Whatever that means.) But will she get her groove back in a tiny rented apartment, with a mountain of boxes, visible panty lines, and a slight wine-and-Cheetos problem?<br><br><em>"I was a thirty-something woman living alone with four cats. I was probably going to be divorced. I was on the short bus to crazy. I pictured my grandmother making hoop-skirted yarn cozies for the toilet paper. I pictured myself making doilies for furniture that I did not own. I saw my cats wearing knitted hats with lace appliqu�s. From my vantage point, knitting seemed like 100 percent of some road I did not want to walk down."<br><br></em>Yet, surprisingly, it's knitting that saves her and emboldens her to become fully engaged in life again--to discover new friends; to take risks, however scary; and to navigate the ins and outs of the modern dating scene.<br></p> <p><em>"Dating has changed in a decade. Now there is a higher chance of meeting someone who has an internet porn addiction than someone who has a job.

Then he'll ask you to read his screenplay."<br><br></em>And such is life in this quirky, irreverent memoir, a spin-off of the blog phenomenon, www.crazyauntpurl.com, one of the most successful online diaries in history, exploding to an international fan base of enthusiastic readers. But don't worry, you don't have to knit to love Aunt Purl. You just have to know what it feels like to have loved, to have lost, or to have taken a leap of faith.&nbsp;We've all been there: Pass the wine.</p></p><p>Laurie Perry knits and writes in Los Angeles, where she chronicles her daily life on her online diary, the Crazy Aunt Purl&nbsp;blog.&nbsp;"Crazy Aunt Purl" has been featured in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>and on MSN.com. Perry has written for the<em> Los Angeles Daily News and </em>the <em>Winter Haven News Chief </em>in Winter Haven, Florida. Her original short story "Drunk, Divorced &amp; Covered in Cat Hair" was published in a collection of knitting-themed essays called <em>Cheaper Than Therapy</em>.<p>There are three rules every Southern girl has hammered into her consciousness, and they shape you and haunt you until the day you die.</p><br> <p>Cardinal Rule Number One: <strong>Mind your manners.</strong> </p><br> <p>This is of course the most important rule, especially early on in your upbringing, as it applies to everything from 'watch your mouth' to 'mind your elders,' and encompasses all forms of behavior from 'elbows off that table rightnow' to 'do not look at me in that tone of voice.' As you get on up in years you learn to mind your manners by not pitching a hissy fit when a smile and firm but pleasant tone will do, and by always being strong and kind, and of course you never smoke standing upright or while wearing your sorority pin. Because that is just tacky. </p><br> <p>Cardinal Rule Number Two: <strong>Make the best of a situation.</strong> </p><br> <p>When delivered by your Uncle Truman or a male teacher or your softball coach, this rule can sound like 'Keep your chin up' or 'Put your game face on.' Sometimes there's a bait-and-switch approach, where you may have (in a moment of weakness) confessed some sad or upsetting thing to a willing human listener, and they reply back with a long, often horribly detailed story of the so-and-so girl who faces a far worse and more disastrous situation than you yourself could even imagine, which I suppose is meant to make you feel better about your own pathetic sob story but on me has the opposite effect. </p><br> <p>Cardinal Rule Number Three: <strong>Always wear clean panties.</strong></p><br> <p>This particular gem was amended by my mother when I was sixteen, as she warned me in no uncertain terms to always wear clean panties and <em>keep them on.</em></p><br> <p>These rules presented for me a dilemma of decorum at the best of times and a true test of character at the worst of times. My comportment was once again in the crosshairs on the day this story begins, a day like any other, really, a completely normal day. </p><br> <p>Although I was a married woman of thirty-three years of age living in cosmopolitan Los Angeles, California, and working in a downtown skyscraper (I work at a bank, but it sounds more glamorous to say <em>downtown skyscraper</em>), quite a remarkable departure from my small-town roots, I was now facing the trifecta of Southern Cardinal Rules, brought on by a rather strange and airy sensation in the back regions of my gray pinstripe skirt. </p><br> <p>I felt a draft. <em>Back there.</em></p><br> <p>Today, the day of my inconvenient new rear-facing air-conditioning system, was a day of precarious underwear selection. While I had every intention of going home that very evening and facing Mount Washmore, the laundry pile in my bedroom closet, I was currently Making The Best Of Things. The wash-day panties I was wearing were nothing more than a string holding together some cotton, and not only was it an unfortunate thong-style contraption, it had the novelty of being green and red because I was on my Christmas undies. I had not embarked upon any lunchtime calisthenics, or lobbed kung fu kicks on my coffee break, or done anything, really, aside from sit on my ass in an air-conditioned office and Look Busy. Graphic designers at financial institutions do not have physically vexing jobs. But as soon as I stood up to stretch, I felt it&#x2015;yes&#x2015;a definite draft. </p><br> <p>First I performed the not-so-subtle maneuver of slightly pulling my skirt to the left and craning my head back to see if I could spot the damage. Nothing. </p><br> <p>A quick recon mission with my hands told me all I needed to know: my skirt had distinctly more air-conditioning in the backyard than it had this morning when I pulled it on. Sans panty hose. Meaning, at any moment my Christmas-themed under-things could be exposed to the cruel office air, in <em>August</em>, and also, this was maybe not the sort of impression I wanted my coworkers to have of me. </p><br> <p>I stood in my cubicle and considered the alternatives. No sewing kit, so there's that. No safety pins either. I started for a moment toward the tape dispenser, but let's be honest here: no amount of Scotch tape in the world could keep my ample behind encased in pinstripes. So I did the only thing I could think of, and with my heavy black corporate stapler in hand, I crab-walked demurely through the hallway into the ladies' room. I moved pretty quickly considering all the wind rustling in the eaves behind me, desperately hoping not to run into any chatty or curious or <em>breathing</em> coworkers who might wonder why I had to take my stapler to the restroom with me.</p><br> <p>I made it into the ladies' room without running into anyone, locked myself into the stall (the big one, of course, better for maneuvering), and stripped off my skirt to perform the necessary stapling surgery on the back seam. </p><br> <p>One might imagine that sitting with staples up your backside for the rest of the workday would not be a particularly comfortable thing to do. One would be right. But that's what I did for the rest of that afternoon, squirming as little as possible, wondering if I were up-to-date on my tetanus shots, wondering if I could actually drink a glass of wine the size of my head when I got home, wondering if my mother had envisioned this very scenario when she advised keeping my panties on. I doubted it.</p><br> <p>I drove home that night, a normal night like any other, tired, staples pressing into the backs of my thighs. It was a Thursday, and I sat in traffic trying to decide what to make me and my husband Charlie for dinner. Spaghetti? Baked chicken? Meat loaf? He had very particular tastes when it came to eating, nothing with sauce (except pasta), chunks, or garnishes. No salads and no vegetables besides fried or mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, and (surprisingly) peas. During the first year of our marriage this seemed unusually cruel for a new, young wife who couldn't cook. </p><br> <p>'So you'll eat tomato sauce, like on pizza or pasta, but not <em>actual</em> tomatoes?'</p><br> <p>'Yep.' </p><br> <p><em>'Fascinating.'</em></p><br> <p>Somewhere around year four, I rose to the challenge and began to see cooking as an experiment in creativity: what could I prepare, with my limited skills and his limited palate, that would be edible and also pass the Picky Test? </p><br> <p>That night, I walked through the door, said hi to my husband, 'Hey! Howwasyourday, I got staples in my behind, be right back,' scratched a cat on the head, and stripped off my poor mangled skirt. I made dinner&#x2015;-spaghetti after all. Charlie liked it with extra Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, and we sat eating it at the table on a Thursday night just like any other. And that is when my husband told me he was leaving.</p><br> <p>And then he did.</p><br> <p>And that is where this story begins.</p><br> <p><br>� 2007. Laurie Perry. All rights reserved.

Now, for the first time, best-selling author Evan Thomas takes us into the courtrooms of William's greatest performances as he defends "Godfather" Frank Costello, Jimmy Hoffa, Frank Sinatra, The Washington Post, and others, as well as behind the scenes where the witnesses are coached, the traps set, and the deals cut. <p>In addition to being a lawyer of unprecedented influence, Williams was also an important Washington insider, privy to the secrets of America's most powerful men. Thomas tells the truth behind the stories that made Williams one of the most talked about public figures of his time, including Williams' role in the publication of the Pentagon Papers and the possibility that Williams may have been Watergate's Deep Throat. Based on Thomas's exclusive access to Williams's papers, "The Man to See" is an unprecedented look at the strategies and influence of this exceptional man.</p></p><p><b>Evan Thomas </b>is the author of <i>The Very Best Men: Four Who Dared: The Early Years of the C.I.A.</i>; <i>Robert Kennedy: His Life; The War Lovers: Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst and the Rush to Empire, 1989</i>; <i>Sea of Thunder: The Last Great Naval Command, 1941-1945</i>; and <i>John Paul Jones. </i>His most recent book is <i>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff: President Eisenhower&#x2019;s Secret Battle to Save the World</i>.Engagingly, Newsweek Washington bureau-chief Thomas tells the colorful story of the controversial criminal lawyer who defended spies, mobsters, demagogues, and even industrialists from legal punishment, but who left moral judgments to the ``majestic vengeance of God.'' In many ways, Williams's career was unique. He was a respectable Washington insider whose access to the secrets of the powerful gave him a reputation as a ``fixer'' of legal difficulties, yet he was a criminal lawyer who willingly defended thugs, Mafia dons, and pornographers and lived a fast life among athletes and other celebrities in bars and nightclubs. Although a devout Catholic who attended mass daily, Williams emerges in Thomas's account as an amiable, morally ambivalent rogue who thrived on power. Thomas portrays Williams as an aggressive competitor at the game of litigation who would defend anyone ``as long as they gave him total control of the case and paid up front,'' and for whom defeat was unacceptable. The author shows that Williams was genuinely brilliant as a lawyer--for instance, his successful defense of Jimmy Hoffa, in what initially seemed an unwinnable case, was a stunning display of legal virtuosity. Gradually, Williams's clients became wealthier, and Williams became one of the first, and most celebrated, specialists in ``white collar'' crime. Armand Hammer, Marvin Mandel, John Connally, and Robert Strauss numbered among his clients. Williams became so wealthy from his practice that, among other investments, he eventually became owner of the Washington Redskins and the Baltimore Orioles. Liver cancer, which struck in January 1987 and eventually killed him, prevented him from accepting an offer from President Reagan to helm the CIA.

It was the first American venture to successfully scale the legendary peak and the first successful climb up the hazardous West Ridge (a climb so difficult no one has yet repeated it). In 2012, adventurer Conrad Anker led a National Geographic/The North Face team up the mountain to enact a legacy climb. Environmental changes and overcrowding led to challenges and disappointments, but yet the mountain maintains its allure. Now, steely-eyed Anker leads a team of writers in a book designed to celebrate the world's most famous mountain, to look back over the years of climbing triumphs and tragedies, and to spotlight what has changed--and what remains eternal--on Mount Everest. Telltale signs of Everest's current state, never-before-published photography, and cutting-edge science expose the world's tallest peak--its ancient meaning, its ever-present challenges, and its future in a world of disappearing ice.</p><p><p><b>Breathtaking Images from <em>The Call of Everest: The History, Science, and Future of the World's Tallest Peak</em></b></p> <em> </em> A helicopter drops off injured climbers at Base Camp.

In his first performances since the terrorist attacks of September 11, Dylan debuted many of the songs on his new album, "Love and Theft," including the prescient song of disaster, "High Water (for Charley Patton)." Columbia Records, eerily, had released "Love and Theft" on the same day that the terrorists struck. How, if at all, would Dylan now respond to the nation's trauma? Would he, for once, speak to the audience? What would he play?<br>&nbsp;<br>The new tour had no opening act, but as a concert prelude the audience heard (as had become commonplace at Dylan's shows) a prerecorded selection of orchestral music. And on this tour, Dylan began playing what may have seemed a curious choice: a recording of the "Hoe-Down" section of Aaron Copland's Rodeo. Then Dylan and his band took the stage and, with acoustic instruments, further acknowledged the awfulness of the moment, while also marking Dylan's changes and continuities over the years, by playing the country songwriter Fred Rose's "Wait for the Light to Shine":<br>&nbsp;<br>When the road is rocky and you got a heavy load<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait for the light to shine<br>&nbsp;<br>For the rest of the month, through fifteen shows, Dylan opened with "Wait for the Light to Shine," often after hitting the stage to "Hoe-Down." He would continue to play snatches of Rodeo at his concerts for several tours to come, and now and then he would throw in the opening blasts of Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man or bits of Appalachian Spring. Copland's music from the 1940s served as Dylan's call to order, his American invocation. Sixty years on, whether he knew it or not, Dylan had closed a mysterious circle, one that arced back through the folk-music revival where he got his start to the left-wing New York musical milieu of the Great Depression and World War II.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyone familiar with Dylan's music knows about its connections to the 1930s and 1940s through the influences of Woody Guthrie and, to a lesser extent, Pete Seeger. But there are other connections as well, to a broader world of experimentation with American music and radical politics during the Depression years and after. These larger connections are at times quite startling, especially during the mid-1930s, when shared leftist politics brought together in New York a wide range of composers and musicians not usually associated with one another. Thereafter, many of the connections are elliptical and very difficult to pin down. They sometimes involve not direct influence but shared affinities and artistic similarities recognized only in retrospect. Yet they all speak to Dylan's career, and illuminate his artistic achievement, in ways that Guthrie's and Seeger's work alone do not. The most important of these connections leads back to Aaron Copland and his circle of politically radical composers in the mid-1930s.<br>&nbsp;<br>On March 16, 1934, Copland participated in a concert of his own compositions, sponsored by the Composers' Collective of the Communist Party-affiliated Workers Music League and held at the party's Pierre Degeyter Club on Nineteenth Street in New York. Copland was still known, at age thirty-three, a decade after first making his mark, as a young, iconoclastic, modernist composer. The collective, with which Copland was closely associated, had been founded in 1932 to nurture the development of proletarian music, and it consisted of about thirty members. The Degeyter Club took its name from the composer of the melody of "The Internationale."<br>&nbsp;<br>The review of the concert in the Communist newspaper Daily Worker praised Copland for his "progress from [the] ivory tower" and hailed his difficult Piano Variations, written in 1930, as a major, "undeniably revolutionary" work, even though Copland "was not 'conscious' of this at the time." A few months later, Copland, increasingly drawn to the leftist composers and musicians, won a songwriting contest, cosponsored by the collective and the pro-Communist periodical New Masses, for composing a quasi-modernist accompaniment to the militant poem "Into the Streets May First," written by the poet Alfred Hayes, who is best-known today for his lyrics to the song "Joe Hill." In the 1950s, Copland would publicly disown the piece as "the silliest thing I did." At the time, though, he was proud enough of what he called "my communist song" to bring it to the attention of his friend the Mexican composer Carlos Ch�vez, and to note that it had been republished in the Soviet Union. The Daily Worker's music reviewer later recalled that the contest judges agreed that Copland's song was "a splendid thing."<br>&nbsp;<br>That reviewer, who was one of the founders of the Composers' Collective and wrote under the pseudonym Carl Sands, was the Harvard-trained composer, professor, and eminent musicologist Charles Seeger. At this point, Seeger, a musical modernist, had little use for traditional folk music as a model for revolutionary culture. "Many folksongs are complacent, melancholy, defeatist," he wrote, "intended to make the slaves endure their lot-pretty, but not the stuff for a militant proletariat to feed on." A year later, though, the Communist Party, on instructions from the Comintern, abandoned its hyper-militant politics and avant-garde artistic leanings in favor of the broad political and cultural populism of the so-called Popular Front. The Composers' Collective duly folded in 1936, but Seeger took the shift in stride. In 1935, he moved his family to Washington, D.C., to work as an adviser to the Music Unit of the Special Skills Division of the Resettlement Administration, the forerunner of the New Deal's Farm Security Administration; and he and his second wife, the avant-garde composer Ruth Crawford Seeger, were able to collaborate with their friend John Lomax and his son Alan in helping to build the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. In addition to collecting and transcribing traditional songs that were in danger of disappearing, the archive and its friends would encourage the development of folk music as a tool for radical politics-efforts that eventually helped inspire Bob Dylan and the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Charles's son Peter, then a teenager, had accompanied his father and stepmother to hear Copland discourse at the Degeyter Club, and during the summer of 1935 he traveled with his father to a square dance and music festival in Asheville, North Carolina, run by the legendary folklorist and mountain musician Bascom Lamar Lunsford. The youngster was already a crack ukulele player, but in Asheville he heard traditional folk music for the first time, played by Lunsford on a cross between a mandolin and a five-string banjo-and it changed his life forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few years later, after dropping out of Harvard and working under Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress, Pete Seeger teamed up with a revolving commune of folk artists, including a young songwriter discovered and recorded by Lomax, Woody Guthrie, to form the leftist Almanac Singers, who promoted union organizing, racial justice, and other causes with their topical songs. (The supervisor for one of the Almanacs' recording sessions in 1942, Earl Robinson, had written the tunes for "Joe Hill" and the Popular Front classic "Ballad for Americans"-and in 1935 he had studied piano with Copland at the Workers Music League's school.) In the late 1940s, the Almanac Singers evolved into the Weavers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Weavers' recordings would later prove essential in introducing a younger generation, including Bob Dylan, to the music of Woody Guthrie and in sparking the broader folk-music revival. But the Weavers were not the only influential musical descendants of the Composers' Collective-and not the only ones drawn to American folk music.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the Seegers, Aaron Copland continued his musical career with his politics intact. After winning his Communist song award in 1934, Copland spent the summer with his teenage lover, the photographer and aspiring violinist Victor Kraft, at a cabin his cousin owned in Lavinia, Minnesota, alongside Lake Bemidji and just to the west of the Mesabi Iron Range. Copland worked hard on his abstract and purposefully radical formal work, Statements for Orchestra, but also relaxed and took in what he called the "amusing town" of Bemidji, nearby. As he told a radical friend in New York, the amusements included some political escapades:<br>&nbsp;<br>It began when Victor spied a little wizened woman selling a Daily Worker on the street corners . . . From that, we learned to know the farmers who were Reds around these parts, attended an all-day election campaign meeting of the C.P. unit, partook of their picnic supper and [I] made my first political speech! . . . I was being drawn, you see, into the political struggle with the peasantry! I wish you could have seen them-the true Third Estate, the very material that makes revolution . . . When S. K. Davis, Communist candidate for Gov. in Minn. came to town and spoke in the public park, the farmers asked me to talk to the crowd. It's one thing to think revolution, or talk about it to one's friends, but to preach it from the streets-OUT LOUD-Well, I made my speech (Victor says it was a good one) and I'll probably never be the same!<br>&nbsp;<br>The "good one" for the Communist candidate in Bemidji was, as far as we know, the last political stump speech Copland ever delivered, and his slightly bemused, slightly awkward, and maybe self-ironic description-"the peasantry"? "the true Third Estate"? in northern Minnesota?-makes it sound out of character. But Copland and Kraft did seek out the "Reds around these parts" and joined in their political activity. "The summer of 1934," Copland's most thorough biographer writes, "found him no mere fellow traveler, but rather an active, vocal 'red.' " Thereafter, and until 1949, Copland, if not a member of the Communist Party, was aligned with the party, its campaigns, and its satellite organizations, connections he would later try to minimize and evade under hateful and intense political pressure-and under oath.<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon after he returned to New York, via Chicago, for the winter, Copland had his own reckoning with the Popular Front. But the first great musical sensation to come out of the Composers' Collective group and Copland's circle of friends after 1935 involved another young composer, Marc Blitzstein-who, many years later, would have a direct and profound impact on Bob Dylan, independent of the Popular Front folksingers. Born to an affluent Philadelphia family in 1905, Blitzstein had been a prodigy and made his professional debut at age twenty-one with the Philadelphia Orchestra, playing Liszt's E-flat piano concerto. Like Copland, Blitzstein had studied piano and composition in Paris in the 1920s with the formidable Nadia Boulanger, but after the onset of the Depression, living in New York, he found himself attracted to the radical theater more than to the concert hall. He felt a special kinship with the founders of the left-wing, socially conscious Group Theatre, including Harold Clurman (who had shared an apartment with Copland in Paris), Clifford Odets, and Elia Kazan.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1932, Blitzstein wrote a one-act musical drama, The Condemned, based on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, a leftist cause c�l�bre, that was never produced. Through the mid-1930s, as a member of the Composers' Collective, he wrote film scores and workers' songs, including a submission to the songwriting contest that Copland won. All along, Blitzstein had begun turning to concepts of populist, modernist, left-wing musical theater, blending Marxist politics with jazz, Igor Stravinsky, cabaret, and folk songs. Bertolt Brecht and his musical collaborators Hanns Eisler and Kurt Weill had conceived and advanced these ideas in Germany before the Nazi takeover in 1933, and Eisler and Weill had brought them to New York as political �migr�s. Earlier, Blitzstein had condemned Weill's music as vulgar pandering, but now he had completely changed his mind. In the late summer of 1936, working at what he called a white heat, he completed a new proletarian musical play, The Cradle Will Rock.<br>&nbsp;<br>A hard-bitten allegory of capitalist greed and corruption, capped by an uprising of organized steelworkers, The Cradle Will Rock was the first important American adaptation of the Brecht-Eisler-Weill style-and it caused a firestorm. As the show took shape, Blitzstein's sponsor, the New Deal's government-funded Federal Theatre Project, already suffering reprisals from conservatives in Congress, became panicky. Practically on the eve of the first scheduled preview performance, the project, citing impending budget cuts, shut down the production and ordered the theater padlocked. Thinking fast, Blitzstein's collaborators-the young director Orson Welles and the producer John Houseman-vowed to defy the order, rented another theater, redirected ticket holders for the first preview to the new venue, and mounted an astounding sold-out debut. (The audience swelled into a standing-room-only crowd when the company invited passersby in for free.) The Actors' Equity union had forbidden the cast to perform the piece, just as the musicians' union had refused to allow its members to play in what had formally become a commercial production for less than union scale, and so, with Blitz-stein himself playing the score from a piano onstage, the actors spoke and sang their parts from the house. The hastily planned, seemingly spur-of-the-moment debut was a political as well as an artistic sensation. After a brief run, Cradle reopened some months later, by popular demand, under the auspices of Welles and Houseman's new Mercury Theatre company, and ran for an additional 108 performances.<br>&nbsp;<br>Aaron Copland was among those present for the impromptu premiere, and it thrilled him. ("The opening night of The Cradle made history," he wrote thirty years later, "none of us who were there will ever forget it.") Defending the show against charges that it was nothing but leftist propaganda, Copland allowed that "a certain sectarianism" limited its appeal, but he praised its innovative combination of "social drama, musical revue, and opera," and its clipped prosody and score.* Copland, meanwhile, had moved away from the dissonant modernism of his earlier work, and he would soon venture beyond orchestral music to write film scores and ballets. But Copland's own new direction had more in common with the all-American folk-song collecting of Charles Seeger and the Lomaxes that would later strongly affect Bob Dylan than it did with Blitzstein's Brechtian musical theater (which would also affect Dylan's work). Theirs were two very distinct artistic responses to the times, made by two ambitious, left-wing American Jewish composers and friends, one who was destined for international fame, the other for relative obscurity. Yet their sensibilities were closely related, at least in the mind of Aaron Copland.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copland's new, more o...</p></p><h2>Norby the Mixed-Up Robot (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Meet Norby &#x2014; he wants to help, but he's one mixed-up robot!

While the Apostolic Fathers like St. Clement of Rome, St. Ignatius of Antioch, and St. Polycarp had addressed members within the Christian fold, St. Justin is considered to be the first prominent defender of the Christian faith against non-Christians and the enemies of the Church. The chief sources for the uncertain and meager chronological data of Justin&#39;s life are his own writings, the two Apologies and the Dialogue with Trypho. The circumstances leading up to his conversion are recorded in the first eight chapters of the Dialogue, and the events surrounding his death are reported in the Acta SS. Justini et Sociorum, an authentic source of the latter part of the second century. Historians place his birth in the beginning of the second century (ca. 100-110 A.D.) at Flavia Neapolis (today Nablus) in Samaria. Although St. Epiphanius calls him a Samaritan, and he himself refers to his people as Samarians, Justin was not Jewish in either race or religion. His family was rather of pagan and Greco-Roman anscestry. They had come as colonists to Flavia Neapolis during the reign of Titus (79-81 A.D.), the son of Flavius Vespasian (69-79), who had built this city and had granted its inhabitants the privileges of Roman citizens. Obviously, the parents of Justin had considerable means and could afford to give their son an excellent education in the pagan culture of the day. Young Justin had a keen mind, was inquisitive by nature and endowed with a burning thirst for learning. He tried to broaden his knowledge further by extensive travels. Driven by an inner urge and a profound inclination for philosophy, he subsequently frequented the schools of the Stoics, the Peripatetics, the Pythagoreans, and the Platonists. He set out to reach the truth; to gain a perfect knowledge of God was his greatest and only ambition. Dissatisfied with the Stoics and Peripatetics, he tells us of finding temporary peace in the philosophy of the Platonists: &#39;the perception of incorporeal things quite overwhelmed me and the Platonic theory of ideas added wings to my mind, so that in a short time I imagined myself a wise man. So great was my folly that I fully expected immediately to gaze upon God.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>First Force Recon Company: Sunrise at Midnight</h2><p>In 1st Force Recon you performed at a very high level of proficiency.

Months before I reported for active duty in June 1968, I had more than experienced the sting of battle over that very unpopular war. From the spring of 1966 through the spring of 1968, a second front for the war in Vietnam was fought on the college campuses across the United States. I attended and graduated from San Francisco State, one of the most progressive colleges in the country at that time. That is where Vietnam began for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> On March 22, 1968, a light breeze rushed across the wide lawn in front of the San Francisco State Commons and chilled the damp March midafternoon air. Beside the walk, seventy-five feet from the near continuous traffic through the Commons entrance, two U.S. Marine recruiters were passing out promotional information and answering occasional questions posed by students interested in Marine officer programs. Captains Dick Hogens and Gary Lawson, officer selection officers for the Marine Corps San Francisco Recruiting Service, had a standing beer bet, whenever they went &#x201c;body snatching&#x201d; on State&#x2019;s notoriously radical campus, concerning how long it would take for the usual confrontations instigated by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) to occur. I had positioned myself just inside the Commons, a few feet from Hogens and Lawson, ready to come to their assistance if the protesters got out of hand. The seasoned Marines acknowledged my presence through the glass doors without calling any attention to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hogens, a picture-book, six-foot, 190-pound, jut-jawed infantryman with a high-and-tight haircut and little tolerance for campus radicals, normally bet short-term and won. After a thirteen-month Vietnam tour as a rifle company commander from &#x2019;66 to &#x2019;67, when the war had heated up, he did not suffer lightly the usual liberal idealistic moralizing about the justness of the war. He was a Marine, he proudly told his assailants: he went to the war, took care of his men, killed when he had to, and came home reassigned to recruiting duty. His focus in Vietnam, he would say, was always his men and doing his job. He was committed to his profession and to his country. Many times he felt more under fire in the frantic antiwar atmosphere of San Francisco then he recalled feeling in combat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Captain Gary Lawson, a class of &#x2019;64 Naval Academy graduate and Huey gunship pilot, also a Vietnam combat vet, in spite of military roots deeply formed during his Annapolis years, was more philosophical about students&#x2019; rights to dissent. &#x201c;Hoge,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d frequently say, &#x201c;these are just idealistic young college kids trying to find themselves. Give them time and a little more experience and they&#x2019;ll come around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hogens saw it differently. In his view, at least several of the SDS leadership, including Jake McKenney, a chief antiwar, antidraft, antimilitary strategist, were professional students. McKenney was in his late twenties or early thirties, and in the SDS during the chaotic sixties, he had finally found himself a niche with genuine stature. Hogens went nose to nose with McKenney, a philosophy major, several times before being convinced that McKenney planned to make a college career of igniting anarchic fires in the bellies of every naive nineteen-year-old State student in search of a cause. Stealing what he considered a particularly chic term from the Soviet Communist lexicon, McKenney reveled in staging agitprop events to ridicule and undermine his targets. Military recruiters, like Hogens and Lawson, and representatives of agencies and industries associated with supporting the Vietnam War were inevitably besieged by McKenney and his SDS antiwar, antiestablishment activists on campus. Hogens and Lawson wondered when their SDS assailants and their sometimes not-fully-committed followers found time for school.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hogens found it unthinkable that State&#x2019;s students would act so radically toward the school&#x2019;s, and the government&#x2019;s, authority: they were making such a sham of their college educations and they seemed never to be in class. Lawson, who&#x2019;d spent his &#x201c;college years&#x201d; at Annapolis, taking nineteen to twenty-one hours a semester and enduring all the usual indignities and deprivations that entailed, found student antics entertaining if a bit misguided and irresponsible. To its credit, the SDS did not confine its dissent to the Vietnam War: anything establishment-based was fair game. A week earlier, the Dow Chemical headhunter had been run off campus, in spite of the school administration&#x2019;s sanctioning his visit. The San Francisco State administration articulated its policies&#x2014;such as keeping the campus open to recruiters of all kinds&#x2014;adequately, but it consistently shirked its duty to enforce them, particularly in succumbing to the overbearing pressures of the radical left.<br> &nbsp;<br> The SDS was taking on a variety of causes under McKenney and his subordinate leaders to bring &#x201c;equality&#x201d; to the campus and to give the students a voice in what he commonly referred to as &#x201c;all spheres of the San Francisco State educational process.&#x201d; As leader of the San Francisco chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, McKenney took very seriously his role in what the SDS referred to as &#x201c;preaching and practicing the policies of disruption.&#x201d; The causes he and his deputies had targeted reached into all vital areas of student and campus activity. The real student issue at State, as it was nationwide throughout the college and university systems, was control, and who was&#x2014;and should have the right&#x2014;to call the shots, the traditional agencies within the school administration or the students.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Hogens watched a wave of about 150 SDS-led students flowing toward him and Larson, he suspected that business was soon going to get brisk. &#x201c;Hey, Gary,&#x201d; Hogens said, &#x201c;take a look down the Commons. You can buy me my first pint of Guinness at O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait a minute, Hoge. Who says I&#x2019;m buying? If we go another thirty minutes, you buy, Grunt!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lawson watched the small sea of students move steadily toward them. He really didn&#x2019;t expect to win the day&#x2019;s bet, but he wasn&#x2019;t ready to roll over to Hogens yet. &#x201c;My guess, Hoge, is that it&#x2019;s just coincidence we&#x2019;re alone on this beautiful lawn in front of the State Commons and the SDSers are in the area politicking again. This speech-making stuff is the daily bill o&#x2019; fare around here, bro. As I read today&#x2019;s campus rag, the SDSers got bigger fish to fry than two lowly Marine recruiters out to catch a couple of young guys who want to serve their country.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As the SDSers began to close on the recruiters, who stood behind a portable cafeteria table adorned with Marine Corps promotional material, my football teammate, Harry Gualco, Steve Diaz, the former Associated Students treasurer, and I emerged from the front entrance of the Commons. I could see that an SDS confrontation was imminent with the Marines. Hogen and Lawson had signed up Gualco and me a year before. As Gualco and I trotted over to the recruiters, Diaz said he was going to alert the campus police in case things got out of control.<br> &nbsp;<br> The SDS demonstrators had quickly transited two hundred yards of Commons lawn and closed with the Marine recruiters, enveloping them in a crescent-shaped crowd. Captain Hogens and Captain Lawson stood coolly, prepared for the first volleys as the SDS demonstrators strengthened their verbal assault. Gualco and I took our posts on the flanks of the recruiters.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an elected member of the student government (Associated Students treasurer), I officially cautioned McKenney not to interrupt an authorized visit by the Marine recruiters. McKenney ignored my appeal; he was intent on driving the recruiters off, just as he had the Dow Chemical representative. McKenney sensed the growing frenzy of his formation of followers. McKenney knew their cause was right&#x2014;the war was misguided, unjust. He and the officially unrepresented masses had earned their place. They were obligated to change what the establishment would not. Today, McKenney probably thought, we&#x2019;ll win another firefight in the relentless guerrilla war he and his kind had undertaken for the good of all society. Hogens and Lawson, who&#x2019;d been repeatedly counseled by the senior Marine recruiter to maintain their composure, even when antagonized on campus, kept their cool. Gualco and I, plus a few friends from the football team, were losing ours.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once again, I could see that the student sheep were being led by the SDS leadership, McKenney, Tewes, and Stein. That afternoon, McKenney was in the vanguard, demanding that Lawson and Hogens get off the Commons grounds. I was, by then, standing beside Hogens, and intervened. &#x201c;You know I represent the student government. All of us also know that the military recruiters are permitted to come on campus. They&#x2019;re entitled to conduct business just as are spokesmen the SDS sponsors.&#x201d; I directed my comments at McKenney and Tewes, since they were orchestrating the day&#x2019;s protest. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t all of you get back to class where you belong?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But the SDS leaders were not to be turned away that easily, then or in the near future. They believed their continuous agitation was having an effect, and the evidence that they might be right was college president Summerskill and the school administration&#x2019;s vacillation and indecisiveness in confronting the SDS as it disrupted officially sanctioned campus activity with increasing frequency. Just the night before, McKenney and Tewes had exhorted their disciples in the auditorium that the SDS was winning and that the time to increase the pressure had come.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Luke 18-24 MacArthur New Testament Commentary (Volume 10) (MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p><p><b><i>Luke 18-24 </i>concludes <i>The MacArthur New Testament Commentary</i>&#x2019;s look at the longest of the four Gospels. </b>Luke is unique in its historical detail and for how it positions Jesus as the Savior-King not just of the Jews, but of all mankind.

A. Weslager's <i>Delaware's Forgotten Folk</i> chronicles the history of the Nanticoke Indians and the Cheswold Moors, from John Smith's first encounter with the Nanticokes along the Kuskakarawaok River in 1608, to the struggles faced by these uniquely multiracial communities amid the racial and social tensions of mid-twentieth-century America. It explores the legend surrounding the origin of the two distinct but intricately intertwined groups, focusing on how their uncommon racial heritage&#x2014;white, black, and Native American&#x2014;shaped their identity within society and how their traditional culture retained its significance into their present.</p><p>Weslager's demonstrated command of available information and his familiarity with the people themselves bespeak his deep respect for the Moor and Nanticoke communities. What began as a curious inquiry into the overlooked peoples of the Delaware River Valley developed into an attentive and thoughtful study of a distinct group of people struggling to remain a cultural community in the face of modern opposition. Originally published in 1943, <i>Delaware's Forgotten Folk</i> endures as one of the fundamental volumes on understanding the life and history of the Nanticoke and Moor peoples.</p></p><p>C. A. Weslager (1909-94) was an esteemed writer and historian of Delaware. He authored a number of books, including Delaware&#39;s Buried Past and Dutch Explorers, Traders, and Settlers in the Delaware Valley, 1609-1644, both published by the University of Pennsylvania Press, and The Nanticoke Indians, Past and Present.<p>Preface</p><p>When I made Delaware my home several years ago, it was solely because new business opportunities had presented themselves through an intermediary of a large corporation by which I was destined to be employed. The subsequent decision to move family and household effects to Wilmington opened up a new phase of existence that was to bring gratification I had not known before. The new business connection was, and continues to be, a source of pride and satisfaction, at the same time providing adequate means for sustenance in return for my humble services. Quite apart from this necessary but not unpleasant quest for a living, I found in Delaware many things equally enjoyable to occupy the hours between the close of one work week and the opening of the next. What this little state I now call home lacks in size finds compensation in its traditions, people, and the fund of material for those curious about the life of centuries past. The fields along the Brandywine, which once ran red with patriots' blood, the old covered bridges, the colonial architecture of New Castle, the Cape Henlopen sand dunes with their buried pirates' gold, the Christina River valley and its farms, historic sites, and memories of Peter Minuit, Johan Papegoja, Jean Paul Jacquet, Peter Alrichs, and pot-bellied Johan Printz&#x2014;all are worthy of more attention than has yet been given them in American literature.</p><p>I lived in Delaware only a short time when I was told of the existence in the southern part of the state of a strange breed of people called Moors and Nanticokes. My interest whetted, I asked the usual questions that come to one's lips when he learns for the first time of a people shrouded in mystery. Who were they? Where did they originate? I was told many fantastic stories. They were allegedly descendants of a red-haired Irish beauty who married an enslaved Moorish prince; their forebears were eighteenth-century Spanish pirates marooned on the bay shore and rescued by Indian women; they were all that remained of an unrecorded Moorish colony established centuries ago in the lower Delaware Valley. These conflicting legends intensified rather than relieved my curiosity. Purely for personal satisfaction and as a hobby to occupy leisure hours, I set out to seek an authentic account of these folk in old newspapers and books. The paucity of information in these sources left my curiosity unsated, and I took other avenues.</p><p>Inquiries brought me closer to the obscure corners of the state where the Moors and Nanticokes live and where anecdotes of specific individuals and events met my questions. Tales were told of a woman among the "Nanticokes" who never owned a stove but cooked over an open fireplace in her cabin in the pinewoods for more than seventy-five years; of a man with long hair and features like an Indian who walked sixteen times from Millsboro to Philadelphia, a round-trip distance of more than two hundred miles, sleeping en route in graveyards; of a school system where whites, Negroes, Moors, and Nanticokes each demand separate accommodations; of a court case where an Indian was proved a Negro by spiteful neighbors; of herb doctors and magic cures; of Moors who have Negro cousins in one city and white cousins in another. These tales carried my interest to new heights.</p><p>One day it fell my good fortune to meet some of the people called Moors&#x2014;then later I met some of the Nanticokes. I visited with them in their fields and in their schools and churches. I made friends with many of them and learned to call them by name. Asked to come into their homes, first to chat, then to eat, I finally after several months achieved the rare honor of sharing their hospitality as an overnight guest. Over a period Of years, impressions began to gather in my mind. The people stood forth in their true light, and through them I found the answers to the questions that puzzled me. Inasmuch as the information I had gleaned from pursuing my hobby is, for the most part, not readily available, it seemed to me that it should be accessible to others. Undoubtedly others as curious as myself would like to have their questions answered, while those who have never heard of the Moors or Nanticokes of Delaware might be interested in knowing of them. That is the reason I wrote Delaware's Forgotten Folk. It is offered not as a textbook nor as a scientific discussion, but merely as reading entertainment founded on the life history, social struggle, and customs of a little-known people.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the assistance of a number of persons who helped to make this story possible. My good friend L. T. Alexander, a camera hobbyist, devoted many hours to the excellent photographs which are seen in the book. John Swientochowski, who made the ink drawings, is also a capable and painstaking brother hobbyist, and I am indebted for his assistance. Leon de Valinger, Jr., Archibald Crozier, H. Geiger Omwake, Dr. H. V. Holloway, Robert Tatnall, Seal Brooks, and William B. Marye were also most helpful in supplying data or reference material otherwise not available.</p><p>The manuscript was previewed entirely, or in part, by Jeanette Eckman, Anthony Higgins, William P. Frank, John P. St. Vincent, Dorotha Redman Hurst, Walter Hurst, and my indulgent wife, Ruth Weslager. Their combined assistance and constructive criticisms are deeply appreciated. Above all, I am greatly indebted to Dr. Frank G. Speck, who read and criticized each chapter as it was written, and to many Moor and Nanticoke friends who never objected while their histories and personal affairs were being probed.</p></p><h2>Einstein&#39;s Cosmos: How Albert Einstein&#39;s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time (Great Discoveries)</h2><p><p><strong>"A fresh and highly visual tour through Einstein's astonishing legacy." &#x2015;Brian Greene</strong></p><p>There's no better short book that explains just what Einstein did than <em>Einstein's Cosmos</em>. Keying Einstein's crucial discoveries to the simple mental images that inspired them, Michio Kaku finds a revealing new way to discuss his ideas, and delivers an appealing and always accessible introduction to Einstein's work.</p></p><p>Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, famed futurist and acclaimed public speaker, is the author of numerous New York Times bestselling books including The Future of the Mind, Physics of the Future, and Physics of the Impossible. He hosts Science Fantastic, a nationally broadcast radio show, and lives in New York City.Recent popular works about Einstein have magnified select details of his life, such as his tempestuous marriage to Mileva Maric (<i>Einstein in Love,</i> by Dennis Overbye, 2000) or his FBI file (<i>The Einstein File,</i> by Fred Jerome [BKL Ap 1 03]). Such topics are reduced to paragraphs in Kaku's presentation, for Einstein's life ranks second to his science here. Accordingly, Kaku divides his narrative into the three great segments of Einstein's scientific arc: the theory of special relativity in 1905; the theory of general relativity in 1916; and the balance of Einstein's intellectual life. The latter was spent searching for a unified field theory and saw the rise of his phenomenal celebrity, which his peers regarded as a dubious dissipation of genius. However, such lamentations were premature, according to Kaku, who explicates recent discoveries that show Einstein was only audaciously ahead of his scientific time, as usual. An expert in quantum mechanics and string theory, Kaku is an equally able popular writer, vividly evoking the pictorial imagination behind Einstein's revolutionary thinking. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Today scholars celebrate the importance of Hannibal, even though Scipio defeated the legendary general in the Second Punic War and was the central military figure of his time. In this scholarly and heretofore unmatched military biography of the distinguished Roman soldier, Richard A. Gabriel establishes Scipio&#x2019;s rightful place in military history as the greater of the two generals. &nbsp;Before Scipio, few Romans would have dreamed of empire, and Scipio himself would have regarded such an ambition as a danger to his beloved republic. And yet, paradoxically, Scipio&#x2019;s victories in Spain and Africa enabled Rome to consolidate its hold over Italy and become the dominant power in the western Mediterranean, virtually ensuring a later confrontation with the Greco-Macedonian kingdoms to the east as well as the empire&#x2019;s expansion into North Africa and the Levant. The Roman imperium was being born, and it was Scipio who had sired it. Gabriel draws upon ancient texts, including those from Livy, Polybius, Diodorus, Silius Italicus, and others, as primary sources and examines all additional material available to the modern scholar in French, German, English, and Italian. His book offers a complete bibliography of all extant sources regarding Scipio&#x2019;s life. The result is a rich, detailed, and contextual treatment of the life and career of Scipio Africanus, one of Rome&#x2019;s greatest generals, if not the greatest of them all.</p><p>RICHARD A. GABRIEL is a distinguished professor in the Department of History and War Studies at the Royal Military College of Canada and in the Department of Defence Studies at the Canadian Forces College in Toronto. He is a former U.S. Army officer and the author of more than forty books, including&nbsp;<i>Scipio Africanus</i>,&nbsp;<i>Thutmose III</i>,&nbsp;<i>Philip II of Macedonia</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hannibal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Man and Wound in the Ancient World</i>. He lives in Manchester, New Hampshire.&#x201c;What Wellington was to Napoleon, Scipio was to Hannibal, a great captain of true genius and innovation, and the Republic&#x2019;s greatest general. We have had to wait until now for a noted scholar to produce a complete and accurate account of Scipio&#x2019;s military and political life in the detail that the subject deserves. Richard Gabriel&#x2019;s biography of Scipio does just that and makes a unique contribution to our understanding of this great Roman general.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mordechai Gichon, professor emeritus of military history and archaeology, Tel Aviv University, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquities (Mordechai Gichon 2008-05-30)<br><br>&#x201c;An exciting book from one of the country&#x2019;s leading military historians.

Chronologically arranged, this large-format book gives each iconic building its own double-page spread featuring an exquisite watercolor illustration and clearly written descriptions, facts, and features.Gr 4-6-Budding architects are likely to spend hours poring over the gorgeous drawings and fascinating trivia in this large-format title. Beginning with the first man-made huts 400,000 years ago, the book takes readers on a journey through time, exploring well-known structures such as the pyramids, Hagia Sophia, Versailles, and the Guggenheim Museum. Each spread is dedicated to a single building; in addition to a detailed illustration of the structure, it also includes information about the architect, the architectural style, and/or definitions of particular details. For example, readers learn that Westminster Palace was made from limestone, which is easy to carve into elaborate, decorative formations, but it is also highly susceptible to air-pollution damage. Readers also learn about porticos, Doric columns, and other assorted aspects of a building's facade. The bullet-point style of the writing and detailed artwork invite browsing and repeated viewings; readers will also be inspired to look up photos of the actual buildings depicted in the illustrations. The back matter includes a detailed time line and an excellent glossary; the latter is especially important as there are a lot of unfamiliar terms here for young researchers. This title will pair nicely with David Macaulay's Castle (1977) and Cathedral (1973, both Houghton Mifflin), as well as Andrea Beaty's Iggy Peck, Architect (Abrams, 2007).-Laura Lutz, Pratt Institute, New York City&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

But on one special day, everything changes. Now Spencer is strong, funny, wild, brave, free... and gentle, too.</p><p><strong>LOLA M. SCHAEFER</strong> (www.lolaschaefer.com) is the author of more than 200 books for children. Her book <i>Frankie Stein </i>was awarded the Children's Choice Book Award and the Mockingbird Award.

Her two young children helpedinspire her artwork in this book.Spencer is a boy. Each of his boy-typical characteristics-strong, fast, tall, loud, wild, messy-are accompanied by a metaphor comparing him to an animal that is pictured but not stated: he's as strong as a bear slurping honey from a beehive; as fast as a horse galloping off the page; and as tall as a giraffe towering next to a tree. On one special day, though, Spencer is quiet and gentle as he becomes a big brother. As his father cradles the bundle of baby, Spencer sits in angelic repose ready to take on his new big-brother responsibility. The engaging visual cues of Meserve's vibrant and energetic artwork and the story's dynamic pacing turn what could have been just another new-sibling book into something much more. In an oh-so-subtle fashion, Schaefer challenges stereotypical gender roles in this insightful picture book. - Patricia Austin Booklist"<br><br>The never-ceasing flow of new-baby books gets an imaginative jolt in this clever and creative title. Spencer may be a boy, but in him you'll find qualities worthy of the entire animal kingdom. He's fast as a horse, tall as a giraffe, funny as a monkey and more. Yet when his parents come home with a new arrival, Spencer finds a new way to describe himself. He may be like animals in many respects, but now he's gentle, just as a big brother should be. One would be right to question whether it's possible to create a wholly original new-baby picture book, but Schaefer's device of making the title part animal story, part sibling tale is a winning one. The text allows readers to guess what animal Spencer will come to resemble next, until finally there is only one thing left to be. To accomplish this, the tone effortlessly slides from raucous and rebellious to quiet and awe-filled (aww-filled too, to be honest) with nary a hitch. Meserve's digital oil pastels of idyllic grass and trees successfully conjure up both the wild bestiary of Spencer's id and the pastoral calm the new baby brings. In a market glutted with books for newbie brothers and sisters, this is one that stands apart. (Picture book. 3-8) Kirkus"<br><br>Pres-Gr 1 Young Spencer is strong as a bear, fast as a horse, tall as a giraffe, and loud as an elephant. But on one special day, he becomes something he has never been before: a brother. With a simple interactive text and thoroughly engaging illustrations, this book is a perfect blending of words and pictures. Beginning with an image of the child standing beside his grandmother as a car pulls away, digitally rendered oil pastels in bold spring colors depict a dark-haired tyke reminiscent of Maurice Sendak's Johnny. Spencer awaits his parents' return by happily running, jumping, and climbing a large apple tree in his grandmother's yard while large animals appear to define his talents. Short beginning sentences require a turn of the page and a fill-in-the-name-of-the-illustrated-animal for completion ("He was funny funny as a [monkey]."). Large spreads have a sunny quality and are filled with creatures large and small. When his parents finally return, Spencer becomes "gentle," sitting with a pillow in his lap as his father hands him the baby. The final images of this loving family will melt readers' hearts. A special book for the special day. Teri Markson, Los Angeles Public Library SLJ"<br><br>Spencer is a spirited and energetic little boy, characteristics that are described in rich rebus-style illustrated similes ("He was strong-strong as a [picture of bear]," "He was funny-funny as a [picture of a monkey]"). Spencer is about to take on a few new characteristics, becoming "quiet" and "gentle" as he watches for and then welcomes his parents who return home with a new baby sibling. The final spread finds the new family of four lazily spread out on a blanket in the yard while the menagerie of animals from the earlier pages looks on. There is no shortage of books for soon-to-be older siblings, but what makes this one stand out is the celebration of all the great things the older sibling already is followed by the welcome addition of a few new roles; the interactive nature of the text begs for child involvement, functioning almost as a large-scale rebus tale in picture book format. The digital oil pastels feature a country home surrounded by tall grasses and sprinklings of wildflowers, and the setting is perfectly suited to the sense of magic in Spencer's animal imaginings. There is a careful delicacy to the compositions, so that single buds and blades of grass stand out against the sky and yard; Spencer himself has a Sendakian robustness as he bounds about his family's property. While not all older siblings will take to big brotherhood as smoothly as Spencer, his experience is shared here with an abundance of love and affection that plenty of soon-to-be brothers and sisters will warm to. HM BCCB"<br><br>Out in his backyard, Spencer can be a lot of things: tall as a giraffe (with help from a ladder) or loud as an elephant (provided he has two metal trash cans to bang). Strong, fast, messy, wild-Spencer has those qualities and more within him. But the big question is, can Spencer be gentle when Mom and Dad bring home a new sibling? This is more of an extended rhetorical question than a story; it recognizes-celebrates, really-kids' more rambunctious, free-spirited tendencies, while demonstrating that those same attributes aren't mutually exclusive from tenderness, when it's called for. Schaefer (Just One Bite) wisely invites audience participation by never identifying the animals that complete Spencer's many similes, letting images of the creatures provide the answers, rebus-style. Meserve's (Can Anybody Hear Me?) bold digital drawings are a big plus: she gives Spencer an energetic, devil-may-care intensity that will feel instantly familiar to both kids and parents, and Spencer's expansive, slightly wild backyard, with its climbing trees, meadow, and mud hole, will be the envy of all ages.

According to author Matthew Alper, this is no mere coincidence but rather due to the fact that humans, as a species, are genetically predisposed to believe in the universal concepts of a god, a soul and an afterlife. This instinct to believe is the result of an evolutionary adaptation-a coping mechanism-that emerged in our species to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death.</p><p>Spiritual seekers and atheists alike will be compelled and transformed by Matthew Alper's classic study of science and religion. The 'God' Part of the Brain has gained critical acclaim from some of the world's leading scientists, secular humanists, and theologians, and is as a must read for anyone who has pondered the question of God's existence, as well as the meaning of our own.</p><p><strong>Praise for <em>The "God" Part of the Brain</em></strong></p><p>"This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended."&#x2015; Library Journal</p><p>"I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience." &#x2015; Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner</p><p>"This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature.

So begins the personal odyssey that propels the author to an arduous investigation of the entire physical universe that leads him, full circle, back to his own DNA.<br><br>Asserting that it�s no coincidence that every culture has believed in some form of a spiritual realm, Alper posits that the human animal must be genetically �hard-wired� to perceive reality this way. And why would the forces of evolution have selected such a trait? According to Alper, in order to assuage the crippling anxiety engendered by our species� unique awareness of death, we evolved a cognitive adaptation�a coping mechanism�that compels us to believe that though our bodies will one day die, our �spirits� will live on forever. In our brains lie nature�s survival mechanisms in which gods, souls and afterlives are nothing but protective lenses through which humanity is �wired� to view the world...an inherited predisposition Alper refers to as �nature�s white lie.�<br><br>Building upon this �Bio-Theological� premise, Alper goes on to explore the physical nature of religious/spiritual beliefs and experiences, atheism, religious conversion, drug-induced transcendental states, self-conscious awareness, near-death experiences, speaking in tongues, moral consciousness and more.<br><br>In this expanded re-release of what has been referred to as a modern cult classic, Alper asks us to look beyond our inherent religious propensities that repeatedly incite discrimination and war with the hope that we might one day replace them with a more promising secular humanistic ideology.<br><br>�Alper uses a Socratic technique to brilliantly and flawlessly argue that our concepts of spirit and God are derived from the mechanics of our brain...enormously important...full of scientific and philosophical truths.�<br>�Mark Waldman, senior editor, <br>Transpersonal Review�<br><br>After receiving a BA in Philosophy, Matthew Alper has led an unconventional life working as everything from an elementary and high school history teacher in the projects of Brooklyn to a truck smuggler in Central Africa, a personal tutor in the Philippines, and a produced screenwriter in Germany, after which he went on to write his acclaimed work, The �God� Part of the Brain.<br><br>�Your book was sensational.

A group of ethnically diverse women makes up this Chicago prayer group, which is facing the challenges of a hate crime, the early parole of one woman, and the marriage of another. All the women (and men) are convincingly portrayed by Rosenblat, including the secondary characters. Her rendition of the frequent prayers is heartfelt, and her musical talents are delightful as she sings the story's hymns. Rosenblat is warm, real, and in the moment as she imbues the narration with her own spirit along with that of the prayer group--a powerful combination.

Lincoln realized that the Civil War had taken on a wider significance that all of Europe and Latin America was watching to see whether the United States, a beleaguered model of democracy, would indeed perish from the earth.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>The Cause of All Nations</i>, distinguished historian Don H. Doyle explains that the Civil War was viewed abroad as part of a much larger struggle for democracy that spanned the Atlantic Ocean, and had begun with the American and French Revolutions. While battles raged at Bull Run, Antietam, and Gettysburg, a parallel contest took place abroad, both in the marbled courts of power and in the public square. Foreign observers held widely divergent views on the war from radicals such as Karl Marx and Giuseppe Garibaldi who called on the North to fight for liberty and equality, to aristocratic monarchists, who hoped that the collapse of the Union would strike a death blow against democratic movements on both sides of the Atlantic. Nowhere were these monarchist dreams more ominous than in Mexico, where Napoleon III sought to implement his Grand Design for a Latin Catholic empire that would thwart the spread of Anglo-Saxon democracy and use the Confederacy as a buffer state.<br><br>Hoping to capitalize on public sympathies abroad, both the Union and the Confederacy sent diplomats and special agents overseas: the South to seek recognition and support, and the North to keep European powers from interfering. Confederate agents appealed to those conservative elements who wanted the South to serve as a bulwark against radical egalitarianism. Lincoln and his Union agents overseas learned to appeal to many foreigners by embracing emancipation and casting the Union as the embattled defender of universal republican ideals, the last best hope of earth.&#x201d;<br><br>A bold account of the international dimensions of America's defining conflict, <i>The Cause of All Nations</i> frames the Civil War as a pivotal moment in a global struggle that would decide the survival of democracy.<br><br></p><p><b>Don H.

In a single judicious, skillfully constructed, and very well written volume, Don Doyle has given us a concise but panoramic view of the United States Civil War's impact on world history.

McPherson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</i></b><br> Offering new perspectives on the international dimensions of the American Civil War, Don Doyle portrays it as a world-changing conflict between liberalism and reaction.

In Doyle's telling, the quintessentially American story of our Civil War' becomes an international conflict of arms and ideas, in which the future of slavery and democracy itself was at stake.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Ted Widmer, editor of <i>The New York Times: Disunion: Modern Historians Revisit and Reconsider the Civil War from Lincoln's Election to the Emancipation Proclamation</i></b><br> Lincoln often claimed that American democracy meant much to the rest of the world.

It is the personal statement of a peerless yogin-adept. Certainly the magic of his poetry impresses us that way and surely this Treasury of the Dharmadhatu, the Choyingdzo, reveals the consummation of Dzogchen. In it we are assured that over and above all the yogas and dhyanas of Hindustan, all the ritual and magic of Tibet and all the quasi religious new-age therapies of the West there exists a simple, timeless manner of being, easy of access, requiring no onerous technique or renunciate lifestyle, that can give us some constant satisfaction in this vale of laughter and tears between birth and dying. With Longchenpa, Dzogchen Ati reaches its most complete revelation; the Choyingdzo is Longchenpa&#39;s most revealing statement about the vajra-heart, and Keith Dowman has made a fine translation. The pathless path of Dzogchen comes alive in this poetic exposition of the apex of Tibetan mysticism. The form of language, the translation, the use of poetic invention creates as atmosphere of understanding, as if a mahasiddha were writing in Oxford English with a touch of American slang. This is radical Dzogchen not only in the actual teaching itself, but also in the translation that strikes the flint of idiom to create sparks of wisdom that reveal the whole hologram.</p><p>Keith Dowman, who has translated this text into English and spent his life in the Himalayas, is an initiate into the lineage of Longchenpa and now travels the world teaching the heart essence of Dzogchen. He is renowned for the precision, clarity and accessibility of his translations from Tibetan which include Sky Dancer, Old Man Basking in the Sun, Natural Perfection, and The Divine Madman.</p><h2>The Elements of Style (Original Edition)</h2><p>A masterpiece in the art of clear and concise writing, and an exemplar of the principles it explains.</p><p>William Strunk, Jr. (1869-1946) was professor of English at Cornell University.

The data compiled and portraits created are incredibly detailed, to the point of being invasive. But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information? <i>The Black Box Society </i>argues that we all need to be able to do so&#x2015;and to set limits on how big data affects our lives.</p><p>Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin) reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks, whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment. Self-serving and reckless behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide in code protected by legal and real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars of fines have been levied, underfunded regulators may have only scratched the surface of this troubling behavior.</p><p>Frank Pasquale exposes how powerful interests abuse secrecy for profit and explains ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency is only the first step. An intelligible society would assure that key decisions of its most important firms are fair, nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism. Silicon Valley and Wall Street need to accept as much accountability as they impose on others.</p></p><p>Frank Pasquale is Professor of Law at the University of Maryland, an Affiliate Fellow at Yale Law School&#x2019;s Information Society Project, and a member of the Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society.&#x201c;An exhilarating read, brimming with passion. <b>Pasquale</b>&#x2019;s bold and ambitious book lifts the lid on the &#x2018;black box society&#x2019; by tackling a wide array of issues, from secrecy in finance to credit scoring, from search engines to automated decision-making, from institutional transparency to the relationship between government and big corporations.

Why, he asks, do we assume learning can be reduced to numerical data? What leads us to believe that "standards-based" grading will eliminate the inherent limitations of marks? Or that training students to show more "grit" makes sense if the real trouble is with the tasks they've been given to do?</p> <p> </p> <p>Kohn's analytical style-incisive yet accessible-is brought to bear on big-picture policy issues as well as small-scale classroom interactions. He looks carefully at research about homework, play, the supposed benefits of practice, parent involvement in education, and summer learning loss-discovering in each case that what we've been led to believe doesn't always match what the studies actually say. Kohn challenges us to reconsider the goals that underlie our methods, to explore the often troubling values that inform talk about everything from the disproportionate enthusiasm for <em>STEM</em> subjects to claims made for more "effective" teaching strategies.</p> <p> </p> <p>During these dark days in which teachers are viewed as expendable test-prep technicians, and "global economic competitiveness" eclipses what children need, Kohn calls for us to summon the courage to act on what we already know makes sense.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Alfie Kohn </strong>writes and speaks widely on human behavior, education, and parenting. The author of thirteen books and scores of articles, he lectures at education conferences and universities as well as to parent groups and corporations. Kohn's criticisms of competition and rewards have been widely discussed and debated, and he has been described in <em>Time</em> magazine as "perhaps the country's most outspoken critic of education's fixation on grades [and] test scores."</p></p><p><p>Alfie Kohn was recently described by Time magazine as "perhaps the country's most outspoken critic of education's fixation on grades [and] test scores."

There are many first-rate quantum field theory books (the venerable Bjorken and Drell, the more modern Itzykson and Zuber, the now-standard Peskin and Schroeder, and the recent Zee), but the immediacy of Prof. Coleman's approach and his ability to present an argument simply without sacrificing rigor makes his book easy to read and ideal for the student. Part of the motivation in producing this book is to pass on the work of this outstanding physicist to later generations, a record of his teaching that he was too busy to leave himself.<br><p> Readership: Graduate students and academics interested in quantum field theory.</p></p><p><i>"Sidney Coleman was the master teacher of quantum field theory. All of us who knew him became his students and disciples. Sidney s legendary course remains fresh and bracing, because he chose his topics with a sure feel for the essential, and treated them with elegant economy." -- Frank Wilczek, Nobel Laureate in Physics 2004<br><p> "When stumped on some physics, I often still ask myself, even after nearly forty years, 'What would Sidney say?' His lectures and their transcriptions were models of clarity and charm. The subjects remain crucial to frontier physics. This volume is a treasure." -- Hugh David Politzer, Nobel Laureate in Physics 2004<br></p></i><p><i> "Ah, quantum field theory: through Coleman's eyes we watch a victory parade that made 'the spectator gasp with awe and laugh with joy'!" -- Anthony Zee, University of California, Santa Barbara and author of</i> Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell<br></p><p> <i>"Sidney Coleman's course on quantum field theory was one of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences of my physics education.

In On the Fourfold Root he takes the principle of sufficient reason, which states that nothing is without a reason why it is, and shows how it covers different forms of explanation or ground that previous philosophers have tended to confuse. Schopenhauer regarded this study, which he first wrote as his doctoral dissertation, as an essential preliminary to The World as Will. On Will in Nature examines contemporary scientific findings in search of corroboration of his thesis that processes in nature are all a species of striving towards ends; and On Vision and Colours defends an anti-Newtonian account of colour perception influenced by Goethe&#39;s famous colour theory. This is the first English edition to provide extensive editorial notes on the different published versions of these works.</p><p>On the Fourfold Root, newly translated here in a readable and scholarly edition, is an essential preliminary to Schopenhauer&#39;s great book The World as Will and Representation. In the companion works Schopenhauer defends his idea that all nature is an expression of will and attacks Newton&#39;s account of colour perception.David E. Cartwright is a Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies and the chair of the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater. He has numerous publications in nineteenth-century German philosophy and has edited and translated a number of Schopenhauer's books, most recently, with Edward E.

It is how we determine perceptions of who we are, those around us, and the social structure in which we operate. <i>Rhetorical Theory,</i> Second Edition introduces a broad selection of classical and contemporary theoretical approaches to understanding and using rhetoric. Historical context reveals why rhetorical theories were created, while present-day examples demonstrate how they relate to the world in which we live.<p> Borchers and Hundley present conceptual topics in a succinct and approachable manner. The text is organized topically rather than chronologically, so similarities and differences are easily detected in central ideas.

That&#x2019;s the common thread among the stories found in Out There&#x2014;those memorable tales that begin with the promise that, even if no one&#x2019;s life is necessarily hanging in the balance, something may go horribly awry at any moment, and that documenting this misfortune will inevitably yield rich comedic material or a surprisingly poignant moment. Or sometimes both. Out There chronicles fringe athletes, fitness freaks, and others obsessed by ill-advised dreams. It takes us to far-flung places no sane person would want to go. What ties this collection together are the incredible voices of legendary Outside contributors such as David Quammen, Tim Cahill, Susan Orlean, Wells Tower, Christopher Solomon, Patrick Symmes, Taffy Brodesser-Akner, Nick Paumgarten, and many others, who turn their subjects into literary gold and have helped to keep Outside in business for more than forty years.</p><p>Outside is an American magazine focused on the outdoors.

I highly recommend it. These are the wildest tales from the fringe, the very cr�me de la cr�me of madness, divine or otherwise. Here are stories of misadventures mirthful and appalling, vagabonds on hellish journeys, fanatics of freaky sports, and emperors of obsession.

It&#39;s a modern day tale of David versus Goliath, where &#34;David&#34; was one of the last grand (&#34;granny&#34;) lay midwives still delivering babies in the U.S.</p><p>The opening chapter of <b>Why Not Me?</b> is a courtroom scene: the State of Florida Health and Rehabilitative Services vs. Gladys Milton, age sixty-four, for providing illegal medical care. From this point, Gladys Milton looks back, telling her story to Wendy Bovard, a midwife and one of Gladys' many patients. Gladys was raised by her midwife aunt in rural Florida during the years when white doctors and hospitals refused to care for brown and black-skinned people. By the time she is a teenager, Gladys has helped her Aunt deliver dozens of babies. In 1958, after her marriage and the birth of her seven children, Gladys is asked by a school nurse to study to become a lay midwife as part of the state's plan to improve rural health care. Although initially reluctant, Gladys finally agrees, swayed in large part by the encouragement of her husband and children. In 1988, after thirty years of delivering thousands of healthy babies - many remembered in exquisite detail - and after several personal tragedies, Gladys Milton is asked to "retire" from midwifery by the state agency which trained her. When she refuses, she is threatened with "serious charges." Although adamant that "anyone who knows me knows that I'll run a hundred miles out of my way to avoid a fight," she unearths the courage to face her challengers in court. Buoyed by her faith and far-reaching support, Gladys Milton proves her family adage: "Success comes in cans, failure comes in can'ts." <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Child of Glass</h2><p><p>A story about difference, exclusion, and ultimately self-acceptance, <em>Child of Glass </em>explores the interplay between inner and outer and the journey we have to go on to become ourselves.</p><p><em>Child of Glass </em>is about Gisele, a fragile, strong, transparent girl who denounces the meanness that can mark life in the world.

Margie Lane drew a small, leather-bound journal from her pocket and braced it against her knee to jot down the words flooding her mind. The lush treetops in the valley below inspired her. Twisting sideways in the automobile seat for a better view, she tucked her skirt tight under her calves and then placed pencil to paper.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Superintendent Harry Brown guided the old truck around a bend in the gravel road, Margie scrawled a jerky line across the linen page. She bit her lip and tucked the book back into her pocket. Best wait to record the thoughts tonight after she&#x2019;d settled in.<br> &nbsp;<br> The vista sent a shiver across her skin as she composed more lines for her evening log, storing them in her memory. Droplets hanging from each fir needle like so many diamonds. She frowned. Diamonds were her mother&#x2019;s business. Beads of dew, each a tiny mirror reflecting the brilliance of the mountain sky. She filled her lungs with the cold, moist air, heavy with the fragrance of ferns and trees. No jewels could compare to the majesty of God&#x2019;s creation.<br><br>As a child she&#x2019;d dreamed of living and working in Mount Rainier National Park, a park her father had campaigned to create. In time she realized that the daughters of United States senators didn&#x2019;t run off to live in the woods. They endured a slow death at the hand of high-society parties and tedious political functions.<br> &nbsp;<br> But one fact remained&#x2014;Philip wouldn&#x2019;t think to look for her here. Margie brushed knuckles across her cheekbone, the skin still tender. Her throat tightened at the memory.<br> &nbsp;<br>The superintendent glanced at her with a smile. &#x201c;Enjoying the scenery, Miss Lane?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> She dropped her hand, her fingers landing on the simple pearl necklace she&#x2019;d chosen to bring on this adventure. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s breathtaking. How much farther?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only about fifteen minutes. I&#x2019;ll take you to headquarters, and you can meet the rangers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie&#x2019;s heart jumped. She&#x2019;d longed to meet the stalwart men of the mountains since she&#x2019;d first turned the pages of Thoreau, Emerson, and Muir. Surely the men of whom Superintendent Brown spoke&#x2014;the<br> Caretakers of Longfellow&#x2019;s forest primeval&#x2014;would approve of her desire to shake off the trappings of the material world and immerse herself in the simplicity of God&#x2019;s creation. They needn&#x2019;t know the rest. &#x201c;How many rangers work at the park?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He pushed back his hat and glanced at the sky. &#x201c;The whole park? We have six permanent rangers and bring on seventeen or eighteen more during the summer months. You&#x2019;ll be working with Chief Ranger Brayden, getting things ready for the camping season.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The first man she&#x2019;d need to impress. Hopefully she&#x2019;d memorized enough botany and zoology books to suffice. Margie tightened the scarf around her shoulders as the cool spring air teased her neck beneath the edge of her cloche hat. &#x201c;Has he worked long for the National Park Service?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Brown snorted. &#x201c;Ford was born on this mountain, and he&#x2019;ll probably die on this mountain&#x2014;like his father before him. The park service couldn&#x2019;t find a better man to look after this land.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ford?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He goes by Ford. Ashford Brayden is his rightful name. Can&#x2019;t think of anyone who calls him that, though.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t we just pass a town named Ashford?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The superintendent nodded. &#x201c;His parents were friendly with the Ashford family, the folks who homesteaded the area.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie sighed. Ranger Brayden&#x2014;born on a mountain, untainted by human society. He sounded like the embodiment of Rousseau&#x2019;s noble savage. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m positive we&#x2019;ll get along splendidly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> --<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford grunted as he swung the double-blade ax, sending yellow chips scattering. The spindly fir listed across the road at a steep angle, its root wad torn from the soggy ground during the storm. A massive cedar on the far side had broken the smaller tree&#x2019;s fall, and now it hung like a drunken man draped over a friend&#x2019;s shoulders. After a few more blows from the ax, the wood creaked. Ford jumped clear as the tree crashed the rest of the way to the muddy road. He wiped his grimy fist across his brow before slogging down the slope.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steam rose from the warm back of the waiting Belgian. Athena stamped her hoof on the gravel-covered hardpan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Walt Jennings wrapped a chain around the gnarled trunk. &#x201c;That makes six trees we&#x2019;ve cleared between here and Narada Falls today. I thought it&#x2019;d take all day to open this stretch after last night&#x2019;s blow.&#x201d; He snapped the fasteners and straightened. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s stoked the fire under you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford grasped the horse&#x2019;s bridle. &#x201c;We could have campers this weekend. Those city folk get perturbed when their fancy automobiles can&#x2019;t make it up to Paradise.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I enjoyed pulling that roadster out of the wash last week. That fellow was pretty hot under the collar seeing his flashy two-seater up to its fenders in mud.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford clucked to the mare. The animal snorted once before dragging the log to the far embankment. &#x201c;Just means more work for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We see more of those folks every year. Last summer their cars and<br> tents were parked higgledy-piggledy<br> all over the meadows.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford sighed. He understood Jennings&#x2019;s concern. Additional people and automobiles meant extra mess and noise. The society folks brought their city ways right to the mountain&#x2019;s flanks without ever considering the dangers. They desired a simple diversion, a taste of freedom before departing in a swirling cloud of exhaust.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilderness showed no mercy, no favoritism. He knew that fact too well.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the log teetered on the edge of the road, Ford bent to unhook the chain. Giving the log a shove with his boot, he sent the timber crashing into the ravine, snapping a small sapling in its path. He glanced at the misty sky. The clouds were burning off, and the mountain threatened to make an appearance. He couldn&#x2019;t wait to get back to headquarters, prop his feet on the porch rail, and inhale a strong cup of coffee. Likely as not, Jennings would head to his cabin to read. That suited Ford just fine.<br> &nbsp;<br> A quiet afternoon alone with his mountain? Nothing could be better.<br> &nbsp;<br> --<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Brown parked the automobile near a cluster of quaint buildings, just six miles past the park entrance. Margie stepped off the running board and sighed as her new calfskin boots sank into the muck. They&#x2019;d been far too clean anyway. Perhaps a few smudges of God&#x2019;s good earth would improve them. Hopefully it would improve her as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Best of all, staying out here in the wilderness would keep her safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> The superintendent banged the car door shut. &#x201c;Welcome to Longmire, or as we fondly refer to it&#x2014;Quagmire. In the summertime, most folks like to continue on up the hill to Paradise, but we keep the headquarters here. The Paradise meadows are pretty enough in July and August, but we&#x2019;d be buried to our necks in snow during the winter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced around the settlement. Whatever jokes the man might make, Longmire&#x2019;s charm couldn&#x2019;t be denied. The limbs of the towering hemlock and fir trees hung low over the squat wooden buildings, roofs were coated with dead needles, and curls of smoke rose from stone chimneys. The National Park Inn, with a wide porch running nearly the full length of the building, stood out in particular. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s lovely.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Longmire family homesteaded here and built a mineral-springs resort. When the park was established in 1899, the administration made quite a few improvements to the area. Lately we&#x2019;ve added a couple of new structures, but we hope to make more changes in the future. Big plans. You might mention that to your father.&#x201d; The stocky fellow hitched up his trousers and smoothed his green jacket.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, it&#x2019;s not at all like you&#x2019;re accustomed to, living in Tacoma and Washington, DC.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie tightened the belt of her wool cardigan as a tremor raced through her shoulders. Thanks to her father&#x2019;s connections, she stood on sacred ground. She didn&#x2019;t like to think what sorts of steps he&#x2019;d taken to make it happen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain I&#x2019;ll adapt, sir. I&#x2019;ve anticipated this adventure my entire adult life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The corners of his lips twitched, and he turned away with a slow shake of the head. &#x201c;If you say so. Let&#x2019;s go inside. I&#x2019;m sure Ranger Brayden will be delighted to meet you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As if on cue, a tall figure appeared in the doorway. Ducking under the low frame, the man stepped onto the wooden porch. &#x201c;Superintendent&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting you today. You brought a guest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie froze midstep. The man facing her resembled nothing short of a Greek Adonis&#x2014;his blond hair glinting in the filtered rays of light, eyes grayer than a bitter tempest. If her imagination had dreamed up such a visage, it couldn&#x2019;t have done a better job.<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Brown placed a hand behind Margie&#x2019;s back and gestured to the stairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> The mud released her feet with only a minor squelch of protest, and Margie climbed the three stone steps to the porch, her heart pounding. Here was the man who would teach her the mysteries of the forest, the secrets of the mountain&#x2014;her spiritual guide into the divine wilds.<br> &nbsp;<br> The superintendent shook the ranger&#x2019;s extended hand. &#x201c;Ford, I have someone for you to meet. This is Miss Margaret Lane, and she&#x2019;s going to join you fellows for a spell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The ranger&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, lips thinning to a line above his rugged chin. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie pressed a smile to her face. &#x201c;Ranger Brayden, it is such an honor to meet you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man dragged a hand through his hair, brows drawing low. He gave her a quick nod. &#x201c;Nice to make your acquaintance, Miss.&#x201d; He turned back to the superintendent. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. Joining us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Brown cleared his throat. &#x201c;Miss Lane, why don&#x2019;t you step inside and have a seat. Ranger Brayden and I will be with you in a moment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Margie swallowed as she pulled her attention from the ranger&#x2019;s stern face, her stomach quivering. His reaction left little room for doubt: her presence was not welcome.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stepped back and pushed open the door for her to enter.<br> &nbsp;<br> She brushed past, the overwhelming odors of sweat and sawdust speeding her steps. A crackling blaze in the stone fireplace warmed the room, casting an amber glow across the dim interior. Two wooden rockers sat together like close companions, and a rag rug softened the plank floor. A ledger sat open on a table. One chair stood askew from the other five, as if Ranger Brayden had been seated before coming to greet them.<br> &nbsp;<br> A narrow stairway led up to what must be a small loft. The ranger&#x2019;s office, perhaps? The building seemed cramped for park headquarters, but perhaps these men didn&#x2019;t spend much time indoors.<br> &nbsp;<br> She wandered over to the hearth, running her fingers across the smooth gray stones. Volcanic andesite, probably hewn straight from the mountain, like Ranger Brayden himself. Doubt curled around her heart. Who was she to think she might belong here? Mama had argued against Margie&#x2019;s decision, and running home would only prove her right.<br> &nbsp;<br> She lowered herself into one of the waiting rockers, the chair creaking as she sat. She&#x2019;d do whatever it took to prove herself worthy of this position.<br> &nbsp;<br> After all, going home was not an option.<br> &nbsp;<br> --<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Harry, she won&#x2019;t last a day.&#x201d; Ford dug his fingers against the weathered porch rail.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lower your voice; she&#x2019;ll hear you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford spun, grinding his heel into the floorboards. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what she hears. What were you thinking?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Superintendent Brown raised his hands. &#x201c;Give me a minute to explain.&#x201d; He pulled off his large hat, smacking the brim against his palm. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re not going to approve, but frankly the brass don&#x2019;t care. We&#x2019;re struggling to make ends meet. The feds make the rules, but they don&#x2019;t like to pay the bills.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do bills have to do with this woman?&#x201d; A twinge pulled at his neck, already sore from poring over the ledger books. He didn&#x2019;t need Harry to tell him they were in trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brown stepped close, glancing toward the doorway before returning his attention to Ford. &#x201c;Her daddy&#x2019;s Senator Thomas Lane. When a wealthy tycoon with Washington connections asks you a favor&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And greases your palm?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His boss scowled. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say, a few donations crossed my desk. Not for my pocket&#x2014;for new park facilities. We&#x2019;re stretched thin after putting up the new community center in the campground. And you still want that administration building by next year?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford lifted his head, staring up at the moss-blanketed roof. The building wasn&#x2019;t that old, but it had been poorly planned. His father had dreamed of erecting a two-story log building with a wide porch designed to welcome weary travelers. If only they had the money. &#x201c;What are we supposed to do with her?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Brown folded his arms across his ample girth. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s working for you, even if her father is paying the bills. She can make nice with the visitors, teach them about the flowers, the trees. The senator assures me she&#x2019;s very knowledgeable.&#x201d; He grunted, jerking his chin toward the small parking area. &#x201c;She can give Jennings a hand with the naturalist programs. Let her give some talks, show people around. Quote poetry.&#x201d; He rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Trust me&#x2014;I heard plenty on the way up here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ford pinched the bridge of his nose. &#x201c;How long? And where&#x2019;s she going to stay?&#x201d; A young, dark-haired beauty living among his men? It sounded like a recipe for disaster.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got empty quarters, and I&#x2019;m betting she&#x2019;ll be ready to return to civilization in a few weeks. But Ford, don&#x2019;t do anything to hurry things along. We don&#x2019;t want her running home to Daddy in tears. Understand?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As a Douglas squirrel chattered in a nearby tree, the sound rattled in Ford&#x2019;s head along with his boss&#x2019;s demands. &#x201c;This scheme is doomed and you know it, Harry. I&#x2019;m not the man for this job&#x2014;entertaining little rich girls? I&#x2019;m not cut from that sort of cloth.&#x201d; His mouth went dry. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad enough we have to pander to the townsfolk who come out on the weekends&#x2014;now they can demand work?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You want to keep your job? Continue living here in the park?&#x201d; Brown&#x2019;s bushy eyebrows folded inward. &#x201c;Find a way to make it work. Show her a good time.&#x201d; He snorted, a smirk pulling at the corners of his mouth. &#x201c;Who knows? Maybe she can turn you into a gentleman.&#x201d; Ford gritted his teeth. &#x201c;Unlikely.&#x201d;</p><h2>National Geographic Walking Prague: The Best of the City (National Geographic Walking Guide)</h2><p>See the best of Prague with this streamlined walking guide, complete with 12 step-by-step itineraries and maps, to help you explore the city like a pro and navigate like a local.

In <i>Onigamiising</i> Linda LeGarde Grover accompanies us through this cycle of the seasons, one year in a lifelong journey on the path to Mino Bimaadiziwin, the living of a good life.&nbsp;</p><p>In fifty short essays, Grover reflects on the spiritual beliefs and everyday practices that carry the Ojibwe through the year and connect them to this northern land of rugged splendor.

This book relates nutrient minerals to chronic fatigue and other common health problems that are poorly understood by traditional medicine and psychiatry. Drawing on over 20 years of personal and professional experience with hair TMA, Dr. Malter explains how the mind and body are closely connected by the effects of stress and other life style factors on nutrient minerals. This is a comprehensive book that will help you to make sense out of the vast amount of health and nutrition information that often seems contradictory and confusing. If you take vitamins and minerals, this book is essential reading.</p><p>Dr. Rick Malter earned his Ph.D. in clinical and educational psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1971. Earlier, he earned the A.B. degree in 1958 and, in 1964, the M.A. degree in Human Development, clinical psychology from the University of Chicago. He earned a certificate in School Psychology in 1967 and passed the Illinois Psychologists&#x2019; licensing examination in 1969. He became an Illinois Licensed Nutrition Counselor in 1996. <p>Dr. Malter worked as a school psychologist until 1976. After meeting Dr. John Cooper, Dr. Malter trained with Dr. Cooper until 1979, learning about Dr. Cooper&#x2019;s concept of the Judge in personality (a phenomenological concept). In 1979, Dr. Malter started his own group practice in suburban Chicago. Dr. Malter&#x2019;s practice involved individual, group, and family therapy as well as psycho-educational assessments of children, adolescents, and adults who showed symptoms of Learning Disabilities and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). He has a special interest in auditory memory and language processing components in ADD. </p><p>Dr. Malter expanded Dr. Cooper&#x2019;s Judge concept into an integrated new model that also incorporated the concept of the "Inner Child" and the Jungian "Warrior" archetype. Imagery and art therapy were integral aspects of Dr. Malter&#x2019;s counseling and therapy work with people. This new integrated model that focused on the Judge concept is described in the book Shrinking the Judge: Freeing the Inner Child that Dr. Malter co-authored with his wife, Rosalie, in 1996. In 2001, Dr. Malter retired from his private practice to Cottonwood, Arizona. </p><p>Dr. Malter has also specialized in nutrition consultation for Learning Disabilities, ADD and stress management. Since a person&#x2019;s Judge reactions tend to intensify under increasing stress, Dr. Malter used nutritional data from hair tissue mineral analysis (TMA) to assess the mind/body connection between stress reactions and psychological dominance of the Judge. He often recommended selected nutritional supplements to reduce the intensity of the person&#x2019;s stress response and, therefore, to reduce the psychological dominance of the Judge. He believes very strongly in an integrated mind/body approach using clinical nutrition and his Judge, Inner Child, Warrior model for bringing about major psychological and emotional changes in a healthy manner without the negative side effects of drugs and medications. Hair TMA is a powerful laboratory tool that helps us to see more clearly how stress and mineral imbalances eventually lead to disease and dysfunction. But, this powerful too! l may also serve as a scientific guide to using nutrition to reverse adverse health trends before they make us sick or dysfunctional.</p></p><h2>The Nephilim Chronicles: A Travel Guide to the Ancient Ruins in the Ohio Valley</h2><p><ul><li><b>Many of the Adena Hopewell mound and earthworks sites photographed for the first time.</b></li><li><b>Directions to "Address Restricted" sites unveiled.</b></li><li><b>Complete historical documentation of the Adena Hopewell mound and earthwork sites.</b></li><li><b>500 photos and maps of the ancient sites.</b></li><li><b>Secrets of the 'sacred landscape' at site locations revealed</b></li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is your travel guide into the mysterious world of the Adena Hopewell mound builders, 1000 B.C.-500 A.D. 222 mound and earthworks sites have been photographed, with directions provided in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Michigan.

By 1980 he was seventy-two years old, and suffering from diabetes and heart disease. One night in December of that year his life intersected with that of Dr. Barbara Roberts, a thirty-six-year old single mother of three, who was the first female cardiologist to practice in Rhode Island.

The Enemy Within chronicles the most prominent witch-hunts of the Western world?women and men who were targeted by suspicious neighbors and accused of committing horrific crimes by supernatural means?and shows how the fear of witchcraft has fueled recurrent cycles of accusation, persecution, and purging. A unique and fascinating book, it illumines the dark side of communities driven to rid themselves of perceived evil, no matter what the human cost.</p><p>John Demos is Samuel Knight Professor of history at Yale University. He is the author of several histories of early America, including <i>Entertaining Satan</i>, which was awarded the Bancroft Prize in American History, and The <i>Unredeemed Captive</i>, which received the Francis Parkman and Ray Allen Billington prizes in American history and was a finalist for the National Book Award. He lives in Tyringham, Massachusetts."No scholar has done more to illuminate the terrifying psychology of witchcraft in Western culture than John Demos. "The Enemy Within" is a masterful synthesis of this phenomenon, stretching over 2000 years, from its origins in Europe through the Salem witch trials, the Red-hunting campaigns of Senator Joe McCarthy, and the modern-day hysteria surrounding Satanic cults and sensational child abuse charges. An elegant writer, a brilliant historical investigator, Demos is the perfect guide for this rich and fascinating journey."<br> --David Oshinsky, winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize in History for "Polio: An American Story" and author of "A Conspiracy so Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy" <br> aOnly John Demos could write this book! In succinct and well-written chapters, Demos introduces readers to the ways in which anger and fear have caused western societies to turn inward in panics we now call witch-hunts. "The Enemy Within," simultaneously sweeping and specific, broadens Demos's earlier work on witchcraft in seventeenth-century New England into a thought-provoking and wide-ranging study.a<br> --Mary Beth Norton, author of "In the Devil's Snare" <br> aA searing story, and a remarkable read. Unlike most historians, Demos does not flinch from taking us up close to real characters. We see the world through the eyes of men and women accused of witchcraft by neighbors they had known for years, as he probes the psychodynamics at work in this terrible experience. In a distillation of a lifetime's research, Demos, who is the foremost scholar of early American witchcraft, reveals patterns that go back to the European middle ages and explains how shifting interpretations of Salem reflect itsplace at the heart of the American psyche.a<br> --Lyndal Roper, Professor of Early Modern History, Balliol College, Oxford<br><br>"There is no one better qualified to tell these stories and write a general history of witch-hunting than John Demos."<br> -"The Boston Globe"<br><br>" No scholar has done more to illuminate the terrifying psychology of witchcraft in Western culture than John Demos.

Many readers curious about the early years of this seminal avant-garde filmmaker will discover here a much more universal story: that of the emigrant who can never go back, and whose solitariness in the New World is emblematic of the human condition." -Phillip Lopate</strong></p><p><strong>"I was enormously moved by it." -Allen Ginsberg</strong></p><p>Legendary filmmaker Jonas Mekas actually came to filmmaking relatively late in life, and his path to New York was a difficult one. In 1944, Mekas and his younger brother Adolfas had to flee Lithuania. They were interned for eight months in a labor camp in Elmshorn. Even after the war ended, Mekas was prevented from returning to his native Lithuania by the Soviet occupation. Classed as a &#x201c;displaced person,&#x201d; he lived in DP camps in Wiesbaden and Kassel for years. It was only at the end of 1949 that Jonas and Aldolfas Mekas finally found their way to New York City.</p><p>A new edition of Mekas&#x2019; acclaimed memoir, first published by Black Thistle Press in 1991, <i>I Had Nowhere to Go</i> tells the story of the artist&#x2019;s survival in the camps and his first years as a young Lithuanian immigrant in New York City. Mekas&#x2019; memoir&#x2015;the inspiration for a 2016 biopic by Douglas Gordon&#x2015;tells the story of how an individual life can move through the larger 20th-century narratives of war and exile and tentatively put down new roots. In the words of Phillip Lopate, &#x201c;This is a lyrical, essential spiritual anthropology.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Jonas Mekas</b> (born 1922) lives and works in New York. Filmmaker, writer and poet, he is a cofounder of Anthology Film Archives, one of the world&#x2019;s largest and most important repositories of avant-garde film. An influential figure in New American Cinema and New York underground culture, he worked with Andy Warhol, George Maciunas, John Lennon and many others. Mekas&#x2019; work has been exhibited in museums and festivals worldwide.</p></p><p>In the years of the diary, 1944 to 1955, as Mekas navigates postwar Europe and the immigrant landscape of midcentury New York, uncertainty was the only constant . . .

From first page to last, Hough leaves no doubt that he is telling the story not merely of a great sailor but also of a great man."--Jonathan Yardley, <em>Washington Post Book World</em></strong></p> James Cook, born in 1728, was one of the most celebrated men of his time, the last and the greatest of the romantic navigator/explorers. His voyages in the Royal Navy to the eastern and western seaboards of North America, the North and South Pacific, the Arctic, and the Antarctic brought a new understanding of the worlds geography and of the peoples, flora, and fauna of the lands he discovered.<br><br> Richard Hough's vivid narrative captures all the excitement of this age of discovery and establishes Cook as a link between the vague scientific speculations of the early eighteenth century and the industrial revolution to come. A pioneer in many fields, Cook produced maps of unprecedented accuracy; revolutionized the seaman's diet, all but eliminating scurvy; and exploded the myth of the Great Southern Continent imagined by earlier geographers and scientists.<br><br> Hough consulted numerous archives and traveled in Cook's wake from Alaska to Tasmania, visiting many of the Pacific islands--including the spot where Cook was stoned to death by cannibals in the Hawaiian archipelago--to produce a comprehensive and immensely readable biography, full of new insights into the life of one of the worlds greatest mariners. Photographs</p><p>Richard Hough, a noted naval historian and author, lives in England.Long before space travel and long before the proliferation of media made the world a "global village," the most dashing and courageous men in the world were such explorers as Captain James Cook. Hough's easygoing, thorough treatment of the early years of Cook's training and the later years of exploration and discovery spotlights a proud, determined man whose exploring was tightly tied to scientific speculations. Cook's meanderings introduced countless new flora and fauna and acquainted Europeans with the many cultures of the Pacific, among them the Maoris and the Hawaiians, the latter of whom dealt the explorer--literally--a death blow. (A spectacular account of Captain Cook's death at the hands of the islanders is one of the high points of the book.) Hough finishes with a flourish by suggesting that a heretofore unknown health problem may have led to the incident provoking the captain's death. The legacy of Cook, last of the great adventurers of the exploration era, is clearly indicated in his transition from exploration in search of gold and riches to modern scientific exploration. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>Disappeared</h2><p><b>* "A tense thriller elevated by Stork's nuanced writing and empathy for every character, including the villains -- superb." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review</b><br><br><b>Four Months Ago</b><br>Sara Zapata's best friend disappeared, kidnapped by the web of criminals who terrorize Ju�rez.<br><br><b>Four Hours Ago</b><br>Sara received a death threat -- and with it, a clue to the place where her friend is locked away.<br><br><b>Four Weeks Ago</b><br>Emiliano Zapata fell in love with Perla Rubi, who will never be his so long as he's poor.<br><br><b>Four Minutes Ago</b><br>Emiliano got the chance to make more money than he ever dreamed -- just by joining the web.<br><br>In the next four days, Sara and Emiliano will each face impossible choices, between life and justice, friends and family, truth and love.

In this careful study for laity, Frances Taylor Gench provides an opportunity for Christians to immerse themselves in this complex Gospel and become better acquainted with its intriguing and distinctive vision. Examining thirteen central texts (including the wedding at Cana, the woman of Samaria, the "I Am" passages, the woman accused of adultery, the raising of Lazarus, and the resurrection scenes), Gench focuses on each text's key features, including literary design, historical origins, and theological insights. Drawing on questions and insights raised by contemporary biblical scholars, Gench helps her readers see these texts anew. She explores the ethical challenges that these texts pose and discusses how this perplexing Gospel can inform Christian life and faith and the practice of daily ministry. Each chapter concludes with thoughtful and engaging study questions for individual or group use.</p></p><p><b>Frances Taylor Gench</b> is Herbert Worth and Annie H.

I hear our modem playing bad jazz as my mother connects to the Internet. I am in the bathroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> I recently discovered that my mother has been typing the names of as-yet-uninvented mental conditions into Yahoo&#x2019;s search engine: &#x201c;delusion syndrome teenage&#x201d;; &#x201c;overactive imagination problem&#x201d;; &#x201c;holistic behavioral stabilizers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When you type &#x201c;delusion syndrome teenage&#x201d; into Yahoo, the first page it offers you is to do with Cotard&#x2019;s Syndrome. Cotard&#x2019;s Syndrome is a branch of autism where people believe they are dead. The Web site features some choice quotes from victims of the disease. For a while I was slipping these phrases into lulls in conversation at dinnertime or when my mother asked about my day at school.<br> &#x201c;My body has been replaced by a shell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My internal organs are made of stone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have been dead for years.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I have stopped saying these things. The more I pretended to be a corpse, the less open she became about issues of mental health.<br> &nbsp;<br> I used to write questionnaires for my parents. I wanted to get to know them better. I asked things like:<br> &nbsp;<br> What hereditary illnesses am I likely to inherit?<br> &nbsp;<br> What money and land am I likely to inherit?<br> &nbsp;<br> Multiple choice: If your child was adopted, at what age would you choose to tell him about his real mother?<br> &nbsp;<br> A)4&#x2013;8<br> B)9&#x2013;14<br> C)15&#x2013;18<br> &nbsp;<br> I am nearly fifteen.<br> &nbsp;<br> They looked over the questionnaires but they never answered them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since then, I have been using covert analysis to discover my parents&#x2019; secrets.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the things I have discovered is that although my father&#x2019;s beard looks ginger from distance, when you get up close it is in fact a subtle blend of black, blond, and strawberry.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have also learned that my parents have not had sex in two months. I monitor their intimacy via the dimmer switch in their bedroom. I know when they have been at it because the next morning the dial will still be set to halfway.<br> &nbsp;<br> I also discovered that my father suffers from bouts of depression; I found an empty bottle of tricyclic antidepressants that were in the wicker bin under his bedside table. I still have the bottle among my old Transformers. Depression comes in bouts. Like boxing. Dad is in the blue corner.<br> &nbsp;<br> It takes all of my intuition to find out when a bout of my father&#x2019;s depression has started. Here are two signals: One, I can hear him emptying the dishwasher from my attic room. Two, he presses so hard when he handwrites that it is possible, in a certain light, to see two or three days&#x2019; worth of notes indented in the surface of our plastic easy-clean tablecloth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gone to yoga,<br> Lamb in fridge,<br> Ll<br> Gone to Sainsbury&#x2019;s<br> Ll<br> Please record Channel 4, 9pm<br> Lloyd<br> &nbsp;<br> My father does not watch TV, he just records things.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are ways of detecting that a bout of depression has finished: if Dad makes an elaborate play on words or does an impression of a gay or Oriental person. These are good signs.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to plan ahead, it&#x2019;s in my interests to know about my parents&#x2019; mental problems from the earliest age.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have not established the correct word for my mother&#x2019;s condition. She is lucky because her mental health problems can be mistaken for character traits: neighborliness, charm, and placidity.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve learned more about human nature from watching ITV&#x2019;s weekday morning chat shows than she has in her whole life. I tell her, &#x201c;You are unwilling to address the vacuum in your interpersonal experiences,&#x201d; but she does not listen.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is some evidence that my mother&#x2019;s job is to blame for her state of mental health. She works for the council&#x2019;s legal and democratic services department. She has many colleagues. One of the rules in her office is that, if it is your birthday, you are held responsible for bringing your own cake to work.<br> All of which brings me back to the medicine cabinet.<br> &nbsp;<br> I slide the mirrored door aside; my face cross-fades, replaced by black and white boxes for prescription creams, pills in blister packs, and brown bottles plugged with cotton wool. There&#x2019;s Imodium, Canesten, Piriton, Benylin, Robitussin, plus a few suspicious-looking holistic treatments: arnica, echinacea, Saint-John&#x2019;s-wort, and some dried-out leaves of aloe vera.<br> &nbsp;<br> They believe that I have some emotional problems. I think that is why they do not want to burden me with their own. What they don&#x2019;t seem to understand is that their problems are already my problems. I may inherit my mother&#x2019;s weak tear ducts. If she walks into a breeze, the tears come out of the far corners of her eyes and run down toward her earlobes.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have decided that the best way to get my parents to open up is to give them the impression that I am emotionally stable. I will tell them I am going to see a therapist and that he or she says that I am mostly fine except that I feel cut off from my parents, and that they ought to be more generous with their anecdotes.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s a clinic not far from my house that contains numerous types of therapist: physio, psycho, occupational. I weigh up which of the therapists will provide the least trouble. My body is pretty much perfect so I plump for Dr. Andrew Goddard, BSc MSc, a physiotherapist.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I phone, a male secretary answers. I tell him that I need an early appointment with Andrew because I have to go to school. He says I can get an appointment for Thursday morning. He asks me if I&#x2019;ve been to the clinic before. I say no. He asks me if I know where it is and I say yes, it is close to the swings.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am amazed to discover that there are detective agencies in the Yellow Pages. Real detective agencies. One of them has this slogan: You can run but you can&#x2019;t hide. I fold the corner of the page for easy reference.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thursday morning. I usually let my Mum wake me up but today I have set my alarm for seven. Even from under my duvet, I can hear it bleating on the other side of my room. I hid it inside my plastic crate for faulty joysticks so that I would have to get out of bed, walk across the room, yank it out of the box by its lead, and only then jab the snooze button. This was a tactical maneuver by my previous self. He can be very cruel.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I listen to it, the alarm reminds me of the car alarm that goes off whenever heavy-goods vehicles drive past. It wails like a robotic baby.<br> &nbsp;<br> The car is owned by the man at number sixteen on the street below us, Grovelands Terrace. He is a pansexual. Pansexuals are sexually attracted to everything. Animate or inanimate, it makes no odds: gloves, garlic, the Bible. He has two cars: a Volkswagen Polo for every day and a yellow Lotus Elise for best. He parks the VW in front of his house and the Lotus out the back, on my road. The Lotus is the only yellow car on my street. It is very sensitive.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have watched him many times as he jogs up through his back garden, swings open the gate, and points his keys at the road. The wailing stops. If it happens late at night, he looks up to see how many lights have come on in the windows of the houses on my street. He checks the car for scratches, tenderly sliding a large hand over the bonnet and roof.<br> &nbsp;<br> One night, it cried intermittently between the hours of midnight and four in the morning. I had one of Mrs. Arlington&#x2019;s maths tests the next day and I wanted to let him know that, in our community, this behavior is not acceptable. So I came home at lunchtime&#x2014;having performed poorly on the test&#x2014;went into the street, and made myself sick on the bonnet of his Lotus. It was mostly blueberry Pop-Tart. The rain that afternoon was fierce and by teatime the lesson had been washed away.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I make it down to breakfast, my dad asks me why I am up so early. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to see a therapist at eight-thirty&#x2014;Dr. Goddard, BSc Hons.&#x201d; I say this as if it is no big deal, this newfound responsibility taking.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stops dead in the middle of slicing a banana onto his muesli. The open banana skin sits in his palm to protect him from the downward slash of his spoon. This is a man who knows about maturity.<br> &#x201c;Oh right. Good for you, Oliver,&#x201d; he says, nodding.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dad admires preparation; he leaves his muesli overnight in the fridge so that it can fully absorb the semi-skimmed milk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s no biggie, I just thought I&#x2019;d like to have a chat about a few things,&#x201d; I say, all casual.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good, Oliver. Do you want some money?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He pulls out his wallet and hands me a twenty and a ten. I know when I am spending Dad&#x2019;s money because he folds the top of his twenties back on themselves, like a bedsheet, so that they fit inconspicuously into his wallet. Blind people also fold their banknotes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eight-thirty,&#x201d; he says, looking at his watch, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive you there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only on Walter&#x2019;s Road. I&#x2019;ll walk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I want to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the car, my dad treats me gently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very impressed,&#x201d; he checks his wing mirror, signals right, and turns onto Walter&#x2019;s Road, &#x201c;that you&#x2019;re doing this, Oliver.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But you know, if you want to talk about anything then, me and your mum have been through quite a lot; we might be able to help.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What sort of thing?&#x201d; I ask.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know&#x2014;we&#x2019;re not as innocent as you think,&#x201d; he says, with a little sideways glance that can only mean sex parties.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would like to have a chat sometime, Dad.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;d be great.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I smile because I want him to believe we have a chummy rapport. He smiles because he thinks he is a good father.</p><h2>The Mediterranean Diet for Every Day: 4 Weeks of Recipes &amp; Meal Plans to Lose Weight</h2><p>Experience the amazing benefits of the Mediterranean Diet in just one month.

Hirshfield&#x2019;s poems of discovery, acknowledgment of the difficult, and praise turn always toward deepening comprehension. Here we encounter the stealth of feeling&#x2019;s arrival (&#x201c;as some strings, untouched, / sound when a near one is speaking. / So it was when love slipped inside us&#x201d;), an anatomy of solitude (&#x201c;wrong solitude vinegars the soul, / right solitude oils it&#x201d;), a reflection on perishability and the sweetness its acceptance invites into our midst (&#x201c;How suddenly then / the strange happiness took me, / like a man with strong hands and strong mouth&#x201d;), and a muscular, unblindfolded awareness of our shared political and planetary fate. <br><br>To read these startlingly true poems is to find our own feelings eloquently ensnared. Whether delving into intimately familiar moments or bringing forward some experience until now outside words, Hirshfield finds for each face of our lives its metamorphosing portrait, its particular, memorable, singing and singular name. <br><br><i>Love in August<br></i><br>White moths<br>against the screen<br>in August darkness.<br><br>Some clamor <br>in envy.<br><br>Some spread large<br>as two hands<br>of a thief<br><br>who wants to put <br>back in your cupboard<br>the long-taken silver.</p><p><b>Jane Hirshfield</b> is the author of six previous collections of poetry, a now-classic book of essays, <i>Nine Gates: Entering the Mind of Poetry, </i>and three books collecting the work of women poets from the past. Her awards include fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, the Academy of American Poets, and the National Endowment for the Arts; three Pushcart Prizes; the California Book Award; The Poetry Center Book Award; and other honors.

The first fully trained and fully equipped group sent to the South Pacific, the 345th racked up a devastating score against the enemy. Armed to the teeth with machine guns and fragmentation bombs, and flying their B-25s at impossibly low altitudes--often below fifty feet--the pilots and air crews strafed and bombed enemy installations and shipping with a fury that helped cripple Japan. One of the sharpest tools in the U.S. arsenal, the 345th performed essential missions during Gen. Douglas MacArthur&#x2019;s campaigns in New Guinea and the Philippines, earning an impressive four Distinguished Unit Citations.<br>This was punishingly dangerous work, and the 345th lost 177 aircraft and 712 men--young men doing their duty in the spirit of the Greatest Generation. Neither was this the more gentlemanly war of Europe, with its more temperate climate, resistance networks aiding downed crews, and POW camps. Airmen shot down in the Pacific theater faced drowning in the ocean, disappearing in the jungle, or torturing and beheading by the Japanese in a war of no quarter expected, no quarter given.<br>A compelling follow-up to Stout&#x2019;s Hell&#x2019;s Angels, Air Apaches reconstructs the missions of the 345th Bomb Group in striking detail, with laser focus on the men who manned the cockpits, navigated the B-25s, dropped the bombs, serviced the planes, and helped win the war. To tell this remarkable story, Stout worked closely with the group&#x2019;s surviving veterans and dug deep into firsthand accounts. The result is a compelling narrative of men at war that will keep readers on the edge of their seats.</p><p>Jay A. Stout is a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot with more than 4,500 flight hours and 37 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm. He has appeared as an aviation and military expert on various TV and radio news programs, including Fox News and NPR. He is the author, among other books, of Hell&#x2019;s Angels: The True Story of the 303rd Bomb Group in World War II, Fighter Group: The 352nd &#x201c;Blue-Nosed Bastards&#x201d; in World War II, and The Men Who Killed the Luftwaffe: The U.S. Army Air Forces against Germany in World War II. He lives in San Diego, California.Combat aviator-historian Jay Stout again demonstrates mastery of his subject, providing an intimate look at the Air Apaches as they bombed and strafed their way from New Guinea to the Philippines and Okinawa. It's all there&#x2014;the appalling climate, treacherous weather, and a determined, lethal enemy. All honor to Stout for another last-minute grab at history that is rapidly disappearing beyond our national horizon. (Barrett Tillman, author of Whirlwind: The Air War Against Japan 1942-1945)<br><br>Informative, exciting, thorough, and stirringly well-written. (Eric Hammel, author of Two Flags over Iwo Jima)<br><br>In his latest aviation treasure, historian Jay Stout chronicles the actions of the 345th Bomb Group, better known as the Air Apaches. Gripping firsthand accounts from pilots and airmen make this an enjoyable read about a unit credited with sinking 260 vessels and destroying 367 enemy aircraft during the war in the Pacific.

Before he escapes, he learns that a fearsome foe is preparing for war - but against whom? <br> <br> When he regains contact with his American and British intelligence counterparts, Alex's worst fears are confirmed. The men in the jungle are highly trained Hezbollah warriors who are planning an unspeakably violent jihad against America. While the United States focuses its efforts on the escalating border disputes with Mexico, Alex vos to put a stop to the deadly plot. Aware that his mission may be the country's only hope, he travels back into the jungle to destroy the lawless mastermind who dares to threaten America's very existence.</p><p>Ted Bell is the former Vice-Chairman of the board and World-Wide Creative Director of Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the world's largest advertising agencies.

An empowering book for anyone held back by sin or doubt, it shows readers how to make freedom in Christ a daily reality by identifying spiritual strongholds in their lives and overcoming them through the truth of God&#x2019;s Word.</p><p>Now, the perennial favorite is available in a convenient day-by-day reading format, helping us find our satisfaction in God, experience His peace, and enjoy His presence with each glorious new sunrise.</p></p><p>From author's website -- www.bethmoore.org<br><p>Beth Moore was born on an Army base in Green Bay, Wisconsin, during what her father describes as the worst thunderstorm the city had seen in five years. He affectionately says the Lord brought her into the world with a drum roll. The fourth child of a retired Army major and a homemaker, Beth was raised in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Her father managed the local cinema where each of her four siblings had a role to play. Beth&#x2019;s job was to hand out samples of popcorn and soda. Growing up in the theater had its perks. Sometimes Beth would be allowed to slip into a movie and take with her a pickle bag full of popcorn and a Dixie cup of Coke. </p><p>There in a theater chair, wide-eyed and filled to the brim with Coca-Cola, Beth began a lifelong love for stories. She loved to tell them, write them, and be told them. The story that captured her heart and consumed her life, however, was not told in a movie theater. It was the story told in Sunday School of Jesus, a Savior who loved children and who thought she was special. A seed was planted in her young heart that would grow to mark her life with a passionate love for Christ. </p><p>At the age of 18, Beth sensed God calling her to work for Him. Although she couldn&#x2019;t imagine what that would mean, she made it her goal to say yes to whatever He asked. Beth graduated from Southwest Texas State University with a degree in political science. She would later receive an honorary doctorate in humanities from Howard Payne University. She married Keith in 1978 and soon after the Lord added Amanda and Melissa to the family. As a young wife and mother, Beth served the Lord by speaking at luncheons and retreats, working at Mother&#x2019;s Day Out, and teaching Christian aerobics. </p><p>A love for the Word of God was embedded in Beth&#x2019;s life when she took a Bible doctrine class at her church. Her teacher was Buddy Walters, a former college football player who taught the Scriptures with tears streaming down his cheeks. She fervently prayed for such a passion for God&#x2019;s Word. It was Buddy who first taught Beth, along with Keith, how to study the Bible. </p><p>Beth founded Living Proof Ministries in 1994 with the purpose of teaching women how to love and live on God&#x2019;s Word. She has written numerous books and Bible studies, including <i>Breaking Free</i>, <i>Believing God</i>, and <i>When Godly People Do Ungodly Things</i>, that have been read by women of all ages, races, and denominations. Through the years, American missionaries and expatriates have taken the Bible studies overseas, resulting in Beth Moore Bible study groups popping up all over the world. Beth&#x2019;s Living Proof Live conferences have taken her to thirty-nine states since 1994 and have been attended by more than 421,000 women. God has graciously given her the opportunity to speak to the body of Christ in many different countries, including Ireland, England, Singapore, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and India.

Written for beginners, this friendly guide presents step-by-step instructions for six easy and effective astral projection techniques.</p> <p>Travel to different times and eras, visit with departed loved ones, and explore different astral worlds, such as the faerie realm. On the astral plane, it's also possible to heal yourself and achieve improved health, send healing energy to others, receive direction from your spirit guides, and view your Akashic records, the astral record of each soul's past and future events.</p></p><p>Astral projection can be a wonderful thing. If you study and learn from <i>Astral Projection for Beginners</i> by Edain McCoy, you'll be on your way to projecting your consciousness out of your body. <br> <br>Several years ago, a person I'd just met asked to do some magick with me. I said, "Sure. To what end?" This stumped the person. He didn't know what to say. He had no goal. <br> <br>Lots of people are enamored of the idea of astral projection for no reason other than wanting to astrally project. To them, getting out of body is enough. This book will be an ideal resource for them. <br> <br>But if you're like me, you may want to have a reason or purpose for projecting. Having such a goal takes astral projection to an entirely new level. In this book you can learn such things as how to gain information about yourself and others, both in current and past lives, by viewing the akashic records. How do you do it? It's in the book. <br> <br>Perhaps you want to learn how to heal others. In the astral state you can easily move energy to correct imbalances and help overcome problems. How do you do it? It's in the book. <br> <br>Or perhaps you would like to use your ability with the goal of making changes here on the physical plane; what is commonly called "magick." How do you do it? You use the technique known as astral creative visualization. And that's fully described in the book, too. <br> <br>No matter what your level, this is an incredible addition to your knowledge. You shouldn't be without it. <br> <br><p>Edain became a self-initiated Witch in 1981 and was an active part of the Pagan community since her formal initiation into a large San Antonio coven in 1983.

Her cousin Sudha is the daughter of the black sheep of that same family. Sudha is startlingly beautiful; Anju is not. Despite those differences, since the day on which the two girls were born, the same day their fathers died--mysteriously and violently--Sudha and Anju have been sisters of the heart. Bonded in ways even their mothers cannot comprehend, the two girls grow into womanhood as if their fates as well as their hearts were merged.<br><br>But, when Sudha learns a dark family secret, that connection is shattered. For the first time in their lives, the girls know what it is to feel suspicion and distrust. Urged into arranged marriages, Sudha and Anju's lives take opposite turns. Sudha becomes the dutiful daughter-in-law of a rigid small-town household. Anju goes to America with her new husband and learns to live her own life of secrets. When tragedy strikes each of them, however, they discover that despite distance and marriage, they have only each other to turn to. <br><br>Set in the two worlds of San Francisco and India, this exceptionally moving novel tells a story at once familiar and exotic, seducing readers from the first page with the lush prose we have come to expect from Divakaruni. <b>Sister of My Heart</b> is a novel destined to become as widely beloved as it is acclaimed.</p><p>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni made an indelible impression on the literary world with her first novel, <i>The Mistress of Spices</i>, a magical tale of love and herbs. <i>Sister of My Heart</i> is less reliant on enchantment but no less enchanting as it tells the tale of two cousins born on the same day, their premature births brought on by a mysterious occurrence that claims the lives of both their fathers. Sudha is beautiful, Anju is not; yet the girls love each other as sisters, the bond between them so strong it seems nothing can break it. When both are pushed into arranged marriages, however, each discovers a devastating secret that changes their relationship forever. <p> <i>Sister of My Heart</i> spans many years and zigzags between India and America as the cousins first grow apart and then eventually reunite. Divakaruni invests this domestic drama with poetry as she traces her heroines' lives from infancy to motherhood, but it is Sudha and Anju who give the story its backbone. Anju might speak for both when she says, "In spite of all my insecurities, in spite of the oceans that'll be between us soon and the men that are between us already, I can never stop loving Sudha. It's my habit, and it's my fate." Book lovers may well discover that reading Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is habit-forming as well. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>Anju is the daughter of an upper-caste Calcutta family; her cousin Sudha is the daughter of the black sheep of that family. Sudha is as beautiful, tenderhearted, and serious as Anju is plain, whip-smart, and defiant. Yet since the day they were born, Sudha and Anju have been bonded in ways even their mothers cannot comprehend.<p>The cousins' bond is shattered, however, when Sudha learns a dark family secret. Urged into arranged marriages, their lives take sudden, opposite turns: Sudha becomes the dutiful daughter-in-law of a rigid small-town household, while Anju goes to America with her new husband and learns to live her own life of secrets. Then tragedy strikes them both, and the women discover that, despite the distance that has grown between them, they have only each other to turn to. Set in the two worlds of India and America, this is an exceptionally moving novel of love, friendship, and compelling courage.</p></p><h2>How to Make a Wish</h2><p><b>A small town pianist ponders a new life away from her embarrassing mother when a beautiful girl shows up and changes everything.

When, why, and where? Thomas R�mer seeks to answer these questions about the deity of the great monotheisms&#x2015;Yhwh, God, or Allah&#x2015;by tracing Israelite beliefs and their context from the Bronze Age to the end of the Old Testament period in the third century BCE.</p><p>That we can address such enigmatic questions at all may come as a surprise. But as R�mer makes clear, a wealth of evidence allows us to piece together a reliable account of the origins and evolution of the god of Israel. R�mer draws on a long tradition of historical, philological, and exegetical work and on recent discoveries in archaeology and epigraphy to locate the origins of Yhwh in the early Iron Age, when he emerged somewhere in Edom or in the northwest of the Arabian peninsula as a god of the wilderness and of storms and war. He became the sole god of Israel and Jerusalem in fits and starts as other gods, including the mother goddess Asherah, were gradually sidelined. But it was not until a major catastrophe&#x2015;the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah&#x2015;that Israelites came to worship Yhwh as the one god of all, creator of heaven and earth, who nevertheless proclaimed a special relationship with Judaism.</p><p>A masterpiece of detective work and exposition by one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on the Hebrew Bible, <i>The Invention of God</i> casts a clear light on profoundly important questions that are too rarely asked, let alone answered.</p></p><p><p>Thomas R�mer is Professor of the Hebrew Bible at the Coll�ge de France and Professor at the University of Lausanne.</p><p>Raymond Geuss is Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. His books include <i>Changing the Subject</i> and <i>Reality and Its Dreams</i>.</p>&#x201c;R�mer, a distinguished scholar rather than an ideologue, seeks to determine exactly what is historical and exactly what is not in the depiction of God. This is a brilliant book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert A. Segal</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;R�mer presents a scholarly and provocative account of how a minor tribal deity likely grew to become&#x2015;or revealed himself to be&#x2015;Lord of Creation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David O&#x2019;Reilly</b><b>, </b><b><i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;R�mer is interested in the emergence of a deity whose nature is now so familiar that its startling originality no longer startles.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brian Bethune</b><b>, </b><b><i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It reads very well, is well translated and has a bit of the excitement of discovery for engaged readers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John C. Endres and Jean-Fran�ois Racine</b><b>, </b><b><i>America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;R�mer deftly weaves together evidence from the Bible with extra-biblical archeological finds that mention Israel and Yhwh to outline the development of monotheism... Not until Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction in 587 BCE did Yhwh become the universal, monotheistic god untied to place or particular monarch, the god who was later adopted by Christians and Muslims. R�mer writes with clarity and accuracy and tells a compelling story. This book is a masterful work, tying together an enormous amount of information in a concise format.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing quite like this book in English. <i>The Invention of God</i> traces the history of the God of Israel from the late Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period, charting the rise of Yhwh as the sole God.

Now, twenty years later, Graham returns with a new selection, this time from eleven volumes, including previously unpublished work, which, in its breathtaking overview, illuminates of the development of her remarkable poetry thus far.</p><p>In <em>From the New World&#x2014;Poems 1976-2014</em>, we can witness the unfolding of Graham&#x2019;s signature ethical and eco-political concerns, as well as her deft exploration of mythology, history, love and, increasingly, love of the world in a time of crisis. As the work evolves, the depth of compassion grows&#x2014;gradually transforming, widening and expanding her extraordinary formal resources and her inimitable style.</p><p>These pages present a brilliant portrait one of the major voices of American contemporary poetry. As critic Calvin Bedient says, &#x201c;If Graham has proved oversized as a poet in the field of contemporary poetry, it is because she continually recalls the great Western tradition of philosophical and religious inquiry . . . tenaciously thinking and feeling her way through layer after layer of perception, like no poet before her.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>From pulitzer prize winner Jorie Graham, an indispensable volume of poems selected from almost four decades of work</p><p>Much awaited and long needed, <em>From the New World</em>&#x2014;a sequence of poems from Jorie Graham&#x2019;s prior eleven books&#x2014;creates a startlingly fresh trajectory through books whose brilliance and far-reaching innovations have been a significant influence on the landscape of contemporary poetry, both in the United States and abroad. Part spiritual autobiography, part survival manual, <em>From the New World</em> tracks what it is to attempt wakefulness in this our unprecedented historical, social, and ecological crisis. Life as we have known it, both in our persons and on the globe, rises in all its terror and deep mystery from these pages. How are we to be responsible, the book asks; how attend to drastic disappearance and still love? We finally have, in one volume, the stunning story Graham has written to keep both art and the human spirit instantaneously yet enduringly alive.</p><p>&#x201c;<em>From the New World</em> is an indispensable addition to any literary library, a tour de force selection of Jorie Graham&#x2019;s critically important poems to date.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014;New York Journal of Books</em></p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s great body of work, summarized in <em>From the New World,</em> her new career-spanning selected poems...has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing....Graham is to post-1980 poetry what Bob Dylan is to post-1960 rock: She changed her art form, moved it forward, made it able to absorb and express more than it could before. It permanently bears her mark.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014;New York Times </em></p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s poems make use of all the old lyric technologies, as ancient as the breath and the beating of the heart&#x2014;rhythm, the managed intervals of line and stanza, the play of language against silence, and the transformations enacted by metaphor&#x2014;enlisting them to measure a world of spawning complexity and change. But because she finds herself gauged by the world she gauges, a poetry that would seem almost too fine-grained for politics has become, in the past twenty years or so, a sui-generis account of global ills like species extinction and climate change.&#x201d;<em>&#x2014; The New Yorker</em></p><p>&#x201c;Like the greatest filmmakers, Graham is miraculously gifted at tracing those inexplicable moments that carry a thing&#x2014;a crow, the sun, a snowflake&#x2014;from stillness to motion, from wholeness to disintegration and back again....I know of no living poet whose work so aligns with their reason for writing; I know of no living poet with a better reason for writing poetry. In Jorie Graham&#x2019;s vision of a new world, poetry&#x2014;thought in motion&#x2014;is faster and more powerful than money, argument, or destruction. Take me there.&#x201d;&#x2014;Flavorwire</p><p>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s is the best poetry written in English in the last forty years. The achievement of her verse is not only to make something happen: Graham&#x2019;s poetry is something happening....We will always need to read Jorie Graham, and to read her closely, if we want to understand the last forty years of poetry in America (as well as abroad, where her reputation is only growing)....<em>From the New World</em> is now the place to start.&#x201d; <em>&#x2014;Los Angeles Review of Books</em></p><p>Jorie Graham is the author of twelve collections of poetry, including <em>The Dream of the Unified Field</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize.

It also seems that he is on the run from a gang of covert criminal operatives led by a millionaire tech developer. Once he teams up with spunky redhead Camille, the daughter of his temporary guardian, the pieces start to fall into place. It turns out that the boy is the one person who can upend a scheme to sell a faked missing van Gogh painting to the gallery for $183 million. While trying to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, Art (the name is written in his jacket) and Camille also race to find the protagonist's art historian father, who has been feared murdered. Much of the narrative hinges on art history and forgery, as well as the seizure of European masterworks by the Nazis. Hicks integrates necessary details into the contemporary narrative. The book occasionally bogs down in meticulous descriptions of downtown DC geography, the history of the National Gallery, and seemingly endless chase scenes. While the art theft plot and historical context are sound, the idea that a group of successful international criminals could repeatedly be flummoxed by two plucky tweens reaches into absurdity.

In a text that covers how "the most popular fruit in the United States" is grown and harvested, Farmer delves into both basic botany&#x2014;the parts of a flower; how pollination occurs&#x2014;and more advanced concepts, such as grafting. Children encountering plant science for the first time will need help puzzling through the challenging concepts and vocabulary; photosynthesis, for example, is alluded to but not fully explained. Later spreads offer a more accessible overview of apple varieties (pictured in a handsome, illustrated chart), nutrition, and historical significance. The watercolor-and-pencil artwork includes helpful, labeled diagrams as well as multicultural apple lovers, picking, eating, and enjoying the fruit, in the past and today.

Their boat handling, navigation, sail handling, anchoring, and mooring skills all have to be carried out both efficiently and effectively, preferably with a minimum of physical effort (to conserve energy).</p><p> But most sailing technique books assume a crew of three or four, all willing to lend a hand.

What emerges is the study of a man caught in conflicts between family loyalties and his own passionate nature, between the call to political action and devotion to his art, between his support of the native Algerians and his identification with the forgotten poor whites. Exploring Camus's impoverished childhood in the Algerian city of Belcourt, his underground activities during the Occupation in Paris, the intrigues of the French literati who embraced him after the publication of his first novel, L'Etranger, Todd uncovers the solitary private man behind the mask of his celebrity. He shows us a writer isolated by his own success, crippled by the charms of women he could not resist, debilitated by the tuberculosis that did not kill him. The auto accident that did adds only to the ironies in the life of this international giant of twentieth-century literature.</p><p>Olivier Todd's biography of Albert Camus matches its subject's depth by portraying the man as well as the moralist. Born in Algeria and raised in poverty by an illiterate mother, Camus never forgot where he came from. He made his name in Nazi-occupied Paris--publicly as the author of <i>The Stranger</i> and <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, covertly as a member of the Resistance and editor of its newspaper, <i>Combat</i>--but he longed for the North African sun of his youth. During the years of crisis when Algeria struggled to break free from France, Camus alienated both colonialists and revolutionaries by supporting full equality for Arabs but denouncing terrorism. "I believe in justice," he told an Algerian heckler at a 1957 meeting he addressed in Stockholm after winning the Nobel Prize. "But I will defend my mother before justice." It is this preference for the concrete over the abstract that makes Camus such an appealing thinker. Todd's biography, which offers the most fully human depiction yet, is equally engaging.mously engaging, vibrant, and richly researched biography of Albert Camus, the French writer and journalist Olivier Todd has drawn on personal correspondence, notebooks, and public records never before tapped, as well as interviews with Camus's family, friends, fellow workers, writers, mentors, and lovers.<br><br>Todd shows us a Camus who struggled all his life with irreconcilable conflicts--between his loyalty to family and his passionate nature, between the call to political action and the integrity to his art, between his support of the native Algerians and his identification with the forgotten people, the poor whites.

The first time she opened a book on the subject, in 1975, it was to discredit astrology and to prove to an acquaintance that astrology couldn't be believed. However, the first book she opened happened to show a little more than the usual sun sign descriptions and she found enough truth within those pages to convince her that there was indeed something to it. The surprising revelation that the planetary positions at our birth and their movements following birth are somehow synchronized with human events greatly excited her and it wasn't long before she realized she'd found her calling as she delved passionately into the art of astrology as a means by which to learn more about the meaning of life.</p> <p>Her goal is to promote astrology and teach astrologers the most valuable and reliable techniques for interpreting the horoscope.</p> <p>Celeste Teal has continually written for the popular astrology magazines since 1986.

Relentless politicians, intrepid fighters, cunning innovators&#x2014;the times called for bold moves, and this resilient generation would not disappoint. From William Tecumseh Sherman, a fierce leader who would revolutionize modern warfare, to Thomas Nast, whose undefeatable weapon was his stirring cartoons, these are the people who weathered the turmoil to see a nation reborn. Following these extraordinary legends from the battle lines to the White House, from budding metropolises to the wooly west, we re-discover the foundation of this great country.</p><p>One of the most distinguished names in Civil War history, James Robertson was executive director of the U.S. Civil War Centennial Commission and worked with Presidents Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson in marking the war's 100th anniversary. &nbsp;His Civil War Era course at Virginia Tech was the largest of its kind in the nation.

He simply cannot resist the urge to dress up in clothes left over from his vaudeville days--complete with top hat and gold-headed cane--and to perform tricks, play banjo and tell jokes. He taps, twirls and laughs himself to tears on a thrown-together stage in his attic. Artist Stephen Gammell takes full advantage of lamplight to render Grandpa in shadow and silhouette, trivializing the concept of age and creating a feeling of intense nostalgia. Related from the point of view of the children, the text in Song and Dance Man is soft and understated, and Gammell&#39;s artistry is superb.

Materials made from hemp fiber have been discovered in tombs dating back to 7000 B.C. During the Middle Ages hemp was used to treat fevers, insomnia, and malaria. Columbus's ships had sails of hemp, and during colonial times it was universally grown because its strong fibers made superior ropes, sails, cloth, and paper. In fact, hemp was used for money in most of the Americas from 1631 until the early 1800s, and the original drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were written on hemp paper.<br><br>As a food, the oil from hemp seeds has the highest percentage of essential fatty acids and the lowest percentage of saturated fats. Britain and Canada have recently lifted bans on growing industrial hemp and today it is reappearing in the marketplace in an amazing array of products: from lip-salve, jeans, salad oil, and cheese to paper products, composite fiberboard, and biomass fuel.<br><br>This illustrated, easy-to-read guide covers all aspects of hemp:<br><br>� The history of its cultivation worldwide <br><br>� Its role as a source of renewable energy and as an alternative for paper manufacturing and fossil fuels<br><br>� Its versatility as a fiber<br><br>� Its many nutritional and medicinal uses<br><br>� Examines the physiological and psychological effects of marijuana use in recreation and therapy<br><br>� A comprehensive resource section includes information on organizations involved in legalizing hemp, product suppliers, and an annotated bibliography.</p><p>Rowan Robinson is the pen name of an author who chooses to remain anonymous.CURRENT AFFAIRS <br> <br>&#x201c; Hemp is of first necessity of the wealth and protection of the country.&#x201d; <br>--Thomas Jefferson <br> <br>Hemp, Cannabis sativa, has been called man&#x2019;s greatest plant ally. It has been worshipped as a source of spiritual enlightenment and a sustainer of human life, but until recently hemp&#x2019;s amazing past was virtually forgotten. Once at the foundation of civilization&#x2019;s economy, it was not until the twentieth century that hemp was outlawed. But hemp is back. Europe and Canada have lifted bans on growing industrial hemp and it has exploded onto the marketplace in a dazzling array of products: from jeans, sneakers, and lip balm to tree-free paper, fiber board, and insulation. With new technology it is possible to make anything from hemp that we now make from petroleum--including paint, plastic, and biomass energy. <br> <br>In this illustrated, comprehensive guide, Rowan Robinson reveals hemp&#x2019;s hidden history. He examines hemp&#x2019;s role as man&#x2019;s first fiber crop, its role in Hinduism and other world religions, and as the catalyst of cultural revolution in the 1960s. Robinson also exposes the prejudices and cover-ups behind the marijuana hysteria of the last fifty years. <br> <br>Calling on contemporary studies, as well as ancient wisdom, Robinson makes an extensive analysis of the nutritional and medicinal uses of hemp and of its surprising potential to solve some of the world&#x2019;s, most troubling environmental problems such as soil erosion, soil contamination, and deforestation. With a resource section listing the companies and organizations involved in the hemp renaissance, <em>The Great Book of Hemp</em> is your complete guide to the world&#x2019;s most extraordinary plant.</p><h2>The Catholic Verses: 95 Bible Passages That Confound Protestants</h2><p><p>Martin Luther ignited the Protestant Reformation by tacking ninety-five anti-Catholic theses to a church door in Germany. Now Dave Armstrong counters with ninety-five pro-Catholic passages from an authority far greater than Luther: the Bible itself.</p> <p>Protestants (and even many Catholics) will be surprised to see Catholicism so strongly supported by these Catholic verses.</p> <p>Not Armstrong!</p> <p>As a Bible-believing Protestant, he studied Scripture intently. There he encountered countless Catholic verses that convinced him that the Bible is a Catholic book. It was written by Catholics, preserved by Catholics for more than 1,400 years before Luther was born, and even today confirms the claims of the Catholic Church. That s why, says Armstrong, early Protestant opinion was virtually identical to today s Catholic beliefs. </p> <p>With humility and care, Armstrong here explains ninety-five key Bible passages that confound all who would use Scripture to criticize the Church and Her doctrines. These are the verses that have drawn so many serious believers including Armstrong out of their Protestant congregations and into the Catholic Church.</p> <p>Armstrong shows that a fair-minded reading of each of these passages (and of the whole Bible) supports the Catholic position on the key issues that divide Protestants from Catholics. Here is Biblical evidence that Catholicism is right about the nature of baptism, the communion of saints, the Eucharist, and the Church; the authority of the Pope, the Bible, and tradition; the salvific role of faith, good works, relics, purgatory, and Mary; the immorality of divorce and contraception; and much more.</p> <p><em>The Catholic Verses</em> is essential reading for all persons seeking to understand God s word in the Bible and to discover the Church that continues to preach His word faithfully today.</p></p><p>Dave Armstrong is a Catholic apologist and author (convert from evangelical Protestantism in 1991).

On a stormy summer evening, with five young people gathered around a fire, Byron suggests a contest to see who can create the best ghost story. Mary has a waking dream about a monster come to life.

Humans and monsters, once separated by vast cliffs, now roam the surface of Atherton together. The inside of Atherton--where the most troubling secrets are hidden--has been breached. While Edgar embarks on a life-or-death quest to find Atherton's mad maker, his two friends, Samuel and Isabel, venture through dangerous underground realms, confronting deadly cave dwellers, rivers of fire, and waters of life.<br><br>Atherton is not what it seems at all, but something far more dangerous, with a history locked inside the mind of a madman and a future beyond Edgar's wildest imagining.</p><p>Patrick Carman's previous books in the Land of Elyon series (The Dark Hills Divide, Beyond the Valley of Thorns, and The Tenth City) have all been <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. He is also the Creative Director of pcstudio, a packager and pioneer of the multimedia "vBook" (video+book), a format launched in 2009 with <em>Skeleton Creek</em>. He recently authored the fifth title in Rick Riordan's 39 Clues series, <em>The Black Circle.</em>Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;In this sequel to <i>The House of Power</i> (Little, Brown, 2007), manmade planet Atherton continues its calamitous changes. With Vincent and Dr. Kincaid, good-hearted Edgar, 11, warns Tabletop of the approaching hungry Cleaners. The villagers and Highland refugees must unite to survive grotesque creatures and unstable terrain. Samuel and Isabel travel beneath the sinking Highlands searching for Atherton's secret water source. Interesting new locales inside Atherton and the altering lands above present fresh and familiar dangers and (somewhat predictable) discoveries. Answered are the mysteries of Edgar's unconventional roots and the fates of Sir William (Samuel's father) and Dr. Harding (Atherton's creator). With third-person omniscient narration, <i>Rivers of Fire</i> has thought-provoking commentary on social hierarchy and environmental concerns. The action, looming peril, and unique concept make this book. Characterization shifts like the planet. Bookish, curious Samuel continues to test his mettle and daring Isabel shows vulnerability. Orphan Edgar takes on the role of Atherton's caretaker, and evil Lord Phineus becomes a self-sacrificing parent. Readers will root for the perceptive, capable children and sympathize with their frustrations as they face well-meaning and sinister adults alike. The pencil illustrations, opening introduction, and character descriptions refresh and enhance the story. It's important to have read the first book to appreciate and understand this one.&#x2014;<i>Danielle Serra, Cliffside Park Public Library, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Green Arrow, being a chunk of painted plastic, didn't rise to the challenge. The action figure remained impassive, exactly where he'd put it, leaning against the porch post of William's house. Technically it was a shack rather than a house, William reflected, but it was a roof over his head and he wasn't one to complain.</p><p>From that vantage point, the Green Arrow had an excellent view of William's action figure army laid out on the porch, and if he were inclined to offer any opinions, he would've been in a great position to do so. William shrugged. Part of him realized that talking to an action figure was bordering on insane, but he had nobody else to converse with at the moment and he needed to talk this out. The whole situation was crazy.</p><p>"The boys sent a letter," William said.</p><p>The Green Arrow said nothing.</p><p>William looked past him to where the Wood rustled just beyond his lawn. Two miles down the road, the Wood would become simply woods, regular Georgia pine and oak. But here, in the Edge, the trees grew vast, fed by magic, and the forest was old. The day had rolled into a lazy, long summer evening, and small nameless critters, found only in the Edge, chased each other through the limbs of the ancient trees before the darkness coaxed predators from their lairs.</p><p>The Edge was an odd place, stuck between two worlds. On one side lay the Broken, with no magic but plenty of technology to compensate. And rules. And laws. And paperwork. The damn place ran on paperwork. The Broken was where he made his money nowadays, working construction.</p><p>On the other side lay the Weird, a mirror to the Broken, where magic ruled and old blueblood families held power. He was born in that world. In the Weird, he'd been an outcast, a soldier, a convict, and even a noble for a few brief weeks. But the Weird kept kicking him in the teeth the entire time, until he finally turned his back on it and left.</p><p>The Edge belonged to neither world. A perfect place for the man who fit in nowhere. That was how he first met the boys, George and Jack. They lived in the Edge, with their sister Rose. Rose was sweet and pretty and he'd liked her. He'd liked what they had, she and the kids, a warm little family. When William watched them together, a part of him hurt deep inside. He now realized why: he'd known even then that a family like that was forever out of his reach.</p><p>Still, he tried with Rose. Might have had a chance, too, but then Declan showed up. Declan, a blueblood and a soldier, with his flawless manners and handsome face. "We used to be friends," William told the Green Arrow. "I did beat the shit out of him before he left."</p><p>The joke was on him, because Declan left with Rose and took the boys with him. William let them go. Jack required a lot of careful care and Declan would raise him well. And Rose needed someone like Declan. Someone who had his shit together. She had enough trouble with the boys as it was. She sure as hell didn't need another charity project and he didn't want to be one.</p><p>It had been almost two years since they'd left. For two years William had lived in the Edge, where the trickle of magic kept the wild within him alive. He worked his job in the Broken, watched TV on weekends, drank lots of beer, collected action figures, and generally pretended that the previous twenty-six years of his life had not occurred. The Edgers, the few families who lived between the worlds like he did, kept to themselves and left him alone.</p><p>Most people from either the Broken or the Weird had no idea the other world existed, but occasionally traders passed through the Edge, traveling between worlds. Three months ago, Nick, one of the traveling traders, mentioned he was heading into the Weird, to the Southern Provinces. William put together a small box of toys on a whim and paid the man to deliver it. He didn't expect an answer. He didn't expect anything at all. The boys had Declan. They would have no interest in him.</p><p>Nick came by last night. The boys had written back.</p><p>William picked up the letter and looked at it. It was short. George's writing was perfect, with letters neatly placed. Jack's looked like a chicken had written it in the dirt. They said thank you for the action figures. George liked the Weird. He was given plenty of corpses to practice necromancy on and he was taking rapier lessons. Jack complained that there were too many rules and that they weren't letting him hunt enough.</p><p>"That's a mistake," William told the Green Arrow. "They need to let him vent. Half of their problems would be solved if they let him have a violent outlet. The kid is a changeling and a predator. He turns into a lynx, not a fluffy bunny." He raised the letter. "Apparently he decided to prove to them that he was good enough. Jack killed himself a deer and left the bloody thing on the dining room table, because he's a cat and he thinks they're lousy hunters. According to him, it didn't go over well. He's trying to feed them and they don't get it."</p><p>What Jack needed was some direction to channel all that energy. But William wasn't about to travel to the Weird and show up on Declan's doorstep. <i>Hi, remember me? We were best friends once, and then I was condemned to death and your uncle adopted me, so I would kill you? You stole Rose from me?</i> Yeah, right. All he could do was write back and send more action figures.</p><p>William pulled the box to him. He'd put in Deathstroke for George the figure looked a bit like a pirate and George liked pirates, because his grandfather had been one. Next, William had stuck King Grayskull in for Declan. Not that Declan played with action figures he'd had his childhood, while William spent his in Hawk's Academy, which was little more than a prison. Still, William liked to thumb his nose at him, and King Grayskull with his long blond hair looked a lot like Declan.</p><p>"So the real question here is, do we send the purple Wildcat to Jack or the black one?"</p><p>The Green Arrow expressed no opinion.</p><p>A musky scent drifted down to William. He turned around. Two small glowing eyes stared at him from under the bush on the edge of his lawn.</p><p>"You again."</p><p>The raccoon bared his small sharp teeth.</p><p>"I've warned you, stay out of my trash or I will eat you."</p><p>The little beast opened his mouth and hissed like a pissed-off cat.</p><p>"That does it."</p><p>William shrugged off his T-shirt. His jeans and underwear followed. "We're going to settle this."</p><p>The raccoon hissed again, puffing out his fur, trying to look bigger. His eyes glowed like two small coals.</p><p>William reached deep inside himself and let the wild off the chain. Pain rocked him, jerking him to and fro, the way a dog shook a rat. His bones softened and bent, his ligaments snapped, his flesh flowed like molten wax. Dense black fur sheathed him. The agony ended and William rolled to his feet.</p><p>The raccoon froze.</p><p>For a second, William saw his reflection in the little beast's eyes a hulking dark shape on all fours. The interloper took a step back, whirled about, and fled.</p><p>William howled, singing a long sad song about the hunt and the thrill of the chase, and a promise of hot blood pulsing between his teeth. The small critters hid high up in the branches, recognizing a predator in their midst.</p><p>The last echoes of the song scurried into the Wood. William bit the air with sharp white fangs and gave chase.</p><p>William trotted through the Wood. The raccoon had turned out to be female and in possession of six kits. How the hell he'd missed the female scent, he would never know. Getting rusty in the Edge. His senses weren't quite as sharp here.</p><p>He had to let them be. You didn't hunt a female with a litter that was how species went extinct. He caught a nice juicy rabbit instead. William licked his lips. Mmm, good. He would just have to figure out a way to weigh down the lid on the trashcan. Maybe one of his dumbbells would do the job, or some heavy rocks...;</p><p>He caught a glimpse of his house through the trees. A scent floated to him: spicy, reminiscent of cinnamon mixed with a dash of cumin and ginger.</p><p>His hackles rose. William went to ground.</p><p>This scent didn't belong in this world outside of a bakery. It was the scent of a human from beyond the Edge's boundary, with shreds of the Weird's magic still clinging to them.</p><p>Trouble.</p><p>He lay in the gloom between the roots and listened. Insects chirping. Squirrels in the tree to the left settling down for the night. A woodpecker hammering in the distance to get the last grub of the day.</p><p>Nothing but ordinary Wood noises.</p><p>From his hiding spot, he could see the entire porch. Nothing stirred.</p><p>The rays of the setting sun slid across the boards. A tiny star winked at him.</p><p>Careful. Careful.</p><p>William edged forward, a dark soft-pawed ghost in the evening twilight. One yard. Two. Three.</p><p>The star winked again. A rectangular wooden box sat on the porch steps, secured with a simple metal latch. The latch shone with reflected sunlight. Someone had left him a present.</p><p>William circled the house twice, straining to sample the scents, listening to small noises. He found the trail leading from the house. Whoever delivered the box had come and gone.</p><p>He approached the building and looked at the box. Eighteen inches long, a foot wide, three inches tall. Simple unmarked wood. Looked like pine. Smelled like it, too. No sounds came from inside.</p><p>His figures were untouched. His letter, pinned down by the heavy Hulk, lay where he'd left it. The scent of the intruder didn't reach it.</p><p>William pulled the door open with his paw and slipped inside. He would need fingers for this.</p><p>The pain screamed through him, shooting through the marrow in his bones. He growled low, shook, convulsing, and shed his fur. Twenty seconds of agony and William crouched on human legs in the living room. Ten more seconds and he stepped out on the porch, fully dressed and armed with a long knife. Just because the box seemed benign didn't mean it wouldn't blow up when he opened it. He'd seen bombs that were the size of a coaster. They made no noise, gave off no scent, and took your leg off if you stepped on them.</p><p>He used the knife to pry the latch open and flip the lid off the box. A stack of paper. Hmm.</p><p>William plucked the first sheet off the top of the stack, flipped it over, and froze.</p><p>A small mangled body lay in the green grass. The boy was barely ten years old, his skin stark white against the smudges of crimson that spread from a gaping wound in his stomach. Someone had disemboweled him with a single vicious thrust and the kid had bled out. So much blood. It was everywhere, on his skinny stomach, on his hands, on the dandelions around him...; Bright, shockingly red, so vivid, it didn't seem real. The boy's narrow face stared at the sky with milky dead eyes, his mouth opened in a horrified O, short reddish hair sticking up...;</p><p><i>It's Jack</i>. The thought punched William in the stomach. His heart hammered. He peered closely at the face. No, not Jack. A cat like Jack slit pupils but Jack had brown hair. The boy was the right age, the right build, but he <i>was not</i> Jack.</p><p>William exhaled slowly, trying to get a handle on his rage. He knew this. He'd seen this boy before, but not on the picture. He'd seen the body in the flesh, smelled the blood and the raw, unforgettable stench of the gut wound. His memory conjured it for him now, and he almost choked on the phantom bitterness coating his tongue.</p><p>The next picture showed a little girl. Her hair was a mess of blood and brains her skull had been crushed.</p><p>He pulled more pictures from the box, each corresponding to a body in his memory. Eight murdered children lay on his porch. Eight murdered changeling children.</p><p>The Weird had little use for changelings like him. The Dukedom of Louisiana killed his kind outright, the moment they were born. In Adrianglia, any mother who'd given birth to a changeling child could surrender her baby to the government, no questions asked. A simple signature on a piece of paper and the woman went on her way, while the child was taken to Hawk's Academy. Hawk's was a prison. A prison with sterile rooms and merciless guards, where toys and play were forbidden; a place designed to hammer every drop of free will out of its students. Only outdoors, the changeling children truly lived. These eight must've been giddy to be let out into the sunshine and grass.</p><p>It was supposed to be a simple tracking exercise. The instructors had led the children to the border between Adrianglia and the Dukedom of Louisiana, its chief rival. The border was always hot, with Louisianans and Adrianglians crossing back and forth. The instructors allowed the kids to track a group of border jumpers from Louisiana. When William was a child, he had gone on the same mission a dozen times.</p><p>William stared at the pictures. The Louisianans had turned out to be no ordinary border jumpers. They were agents of Louisiana's Hand. Spies, twisted by magic and powerful enough to take out a squad of trained Legionnaires.</p><p>They let the children catch them.</p><p>When the kids and the instructors failed to report in, a squad of Legionnaires was dispatched to find them. He was the tracker for that squad. He was the one who found them dead in the meadow.</p><p>It was a massacre, brutal and cold. The kids didn't go quick. They'd hurt before they died.</p><p>The last piece of paper waited in the box. William picked it up. He knew from the first sentence what it would say. The words were burned into his memory.</p><p>He read it all the same.</p><p>Dumb animals offer little sport. Louisiana kills changelings at birth it's far more efficient than wasting time and resources to try to turn them into people. I recommend you look into this practice, because next time I'll expect proper compensation for getting rid of your little freaks.</p><p>Sincerely yours,Spider</p><p>Mindless hot fury flooded William, sweeping away all reason and restraint. He raised his head to the sky and snarled, giving voice to his rage before it tore him apart.</p><p>For years he'd tracked Spider as much as the Legion would permit him. He'd found him twice. The first time he'd ripped apart Spider's stomach and Spider broke his legs. The second time, William had shattered the Louisianan's ribs, while Spider nearly drowned him. Both times the Hand's spy slipped through his fingers.</p><p>Nobody cared for the changelings. They grew up exiled from society, raised to obey and kill on command for the good of Adrianglia. They were fodder, but to him they were children, just like he had once been a child. Just like Jack.</p><p>He had to find Spider. He had to kill him. Child murder had to be punished.</p><p>A man stepped out of the Wood. William leapt off the porch. In a breath he pinned the intruder to the trunk of the nearest tree and snarled, his teeth clicking a hair from the man's carotid.</p><p>The man made no move to resist. "Do you want to kill me or Spider?"</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"The name is Erwin." The man nodded at his raised hands. A large ring clamped his middle finger a plain silver band with a small polished mirror in it. The Mirror Adrianglian Secret Service flashed in William's head. The Hand's biggest enemy.</p><p>"The Mirror would like a word, Lord Sandine," the man said softly. "Would you be kind enough to favor us with an audience?"</p></p><h2>MiG Alley: The US Air Force in Korea, 1950&#x2013;53</h2><p><p><b>Titled after the wartime nickname for the part of North Korea that was the epicenter of a bitter struggle for air superiority over the Korean Peninsula, <i>MiG Alley</i> offers an in-depth analysis of the US Air Force's war in Korea, packed with interesting and exciting personal stories based on first-person testimony from both American and Soviet sources.</b></p><p>Of the many myths that emerged following the end of the Korean War, the prevailing one in the West was that of the absolute supremacy of US Air Force pilots and aircraft over their Soviet-supplied opponents. The claims of the 10:1 victory-loss ratio achieved by the US Air Force fighter pilots flying the North American F-86 Sabre against their communist adversaries, amongst other such fabrications, went unchallenged until the end of the Cold War, when Soviet records of the conflict were finally opened. </p><p>From that point onwards, a very different story began to emerge. Far from decisive American victories over an unsophisticated opponent, the aerial battles of the Korean War were, at least in the early years, evenly matched affairs, fought to an approximate 1:1 victory-loss ratio. Though the Soviet victories declined over the following years, this had more to do with home politics than American tactics.</p><p>Regardless of the accuracy of claims and wartime propaganda, one fact stands clear: in the battle for air supremacy over Korea, the US Air Force denied to its opponents the opportunity to intervene over the battlefield. In the face of overwhelming enemy manpower superiority, this allowed the United Nations forces to hold the line in Korea until an armistice that protected South Korea could be put into effect. </p><p>In addition to the aerial combat over MiG Alley, this title covers the full range of US Air Force activities over Korea, including the failed strategic bombing campaign and the escalating nuclear threat. Incorporating first-hand accounts from those involved, both US and Soviet, this new history of the US Air Force in Korea reveals the full story of this bitter struggle in the Eastern skies.</p></p><p><b>Thomas McKelvey Cleaver</b> has been a published writer for the past 40 years, with a lifelong interest in the Korean War, and this work is the product of 25 years of research.

For decades both the U.S. Air Force F-86s and the Communist MiG-15s claimed a 10-1 victory-loss ratio, an impossibility well known to aviation historians. But with rare resources, <i>MiG Alley</i> demonstrates that the Sabres and MiGs were much closer to parity than previously recognized, while paying tribute to the often outnumbered U.S. pilots who kept enemy airpower off the backs of allied ground forces in the south.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Barrett Tillman, author of 'On Wave and Wing'</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seen as a whole, <i>MiG Alley </i>is a most interesting read, complementing well the author's history of the US Navy's role in Korea, and genuinely offers perspectives that many might not have considered.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Aeroplane Monthly</i></p></p><h2>Now Write!

It was inevitable it would get around to sf and fantasy, and why not? As the book&#x2019;s contributors point out, there are a lot of unique challenges to writing in these genres. The dozens of essays here&#x2014;some by notables including Harlan Ellison, Joe R. Lansdale, and Simon Clark&#x2014;tackle such subjects as freelancing for sf TV series; writing interspecies romance; building an internally consistent system of magic; creating a compelling but believable villain; creating a television series; tapping into the most common human fears; and much more. The book&#x2019;s only drawback may be that, in trying to pack so much into a relatively small space, the editor has selected a lot of very short essays: most of them are only a page or two long, and, in many cases, we&#x2019;re just settling in, and suddenly we&#x2019;re already done. A useful but also a tad superficial book. --David Pitt</p><h2>Ghost World</h2><p>Back for an amazing ninth printing, this is our bestselling book ever, a Catcher in the Rye for its generation and the basis for the Academy Award-nominated film. It tells the story of Enid and Rebecca, two above-it-all best friends confronted with the prospect of adulthood and the uncertain future of their friendship.</p><p>Dan Clowes described the story in <i>Ghost World</i> as the examination of "the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and (mostly) undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish." From this perch comes a revelation about adolescence that is both subtle and coolly beautiful. Critics have pointed out Clowes's cynicism and vicious social commentary, but if you concentrate on those aspects, you'll miss the exquisite whole that Clowes has captured. Each chapter ends with melancholia that builds towards the amazing, detached, ghostlike ending.Daniel Clowes was born in 1961. He is the creator of the comic books Eightball, Ghost World, which was made into a film by the director Terry Zwigoff, David Boring, and Ice Haven. His adaptation of his own Ghost World graphic novel for the screen earned him an Oscar nomination. A regular contributor to the New Yorker, McSweeney&#39;s, and The Best American Comics, he lives in California with his wife.</p><h2>Night Monkey, Day Monkey</h2><p><b>An excellent choice for bedtime, this Smarties Book Prize&#x2013;winning tale of two c</b>o<b>nfused monkeys illustrates the differences between daytime and nighttime</b> &nbsp; Night Monkey and Day Monkey's worlds are as different as night and day!

Our corporations vie for slots in the Diversity Top 50, our universities brag about minority recruiting, and every month is Somebody&#x2019;s History Month. But in this &#x201c;eloquent&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and &#x201c;captivating&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) book, Walter Benn Michaels argues that our enthusiastic celebration of &#x201c;difference&#x201d; masks our neglect of America&#x2019;s vast and growing economic divide.</p><p>When it was first published in 2006, <i>The Trouble with Diversity</i> provoked a firestorm of praise and condemnation&#x2015;not only hailed as &#x201c;genius&#x201d; (<i>The Economist</i>), &#x201c;cogent&#x201d; (<i>The New Yorker</i>), and &#x201c;impossible to disagree with&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>) it was excoriated as a &#x201c;wildly implausible&#x201d; product of &#x201c;the &#x2018;shock and awe&#x2019; school of political argument&#x201d; (<i>Slate</i>) and &#x201c;Seething, misplaced, amnesiac resentment&#x201d; (<i>The Nation</i>). Now, a decade later, Michaels offers a new afterword on how our regime of equal-opportunity exploitation has only intensified. Magnificently iconoclastic, he demonstrates that commitments to diversity fail to offer a premise for social justice and in fact legitimize the economic forces that drive inequality rather than offering a resistance or even a critique. Most importantly, he makes the case that we should pay less attention to the illusory distinction of culture, and more attention to the real discrepancies of class and wealth.</p></p><p>If there&#x2019;s one thing Americans agree on, it&#x2019;s the value of diversity. Our corporations vie for slots in the Diversity Top 50, our universities brag about minority recruiting, and every month is Somebody&#x2019;s History Month. But in this provocative new book, Walter Benn Michaels argues that our enthusiastic celebration of &#x201c;difference&#x201d; masks our neglect of America&#x2019;s vast and growing economic divide. Affirmative action in schools has not made them more open, it&#x2019;s just guaranteed that the rich kids come in the appropriate colors. Diversity training in the workplace has not raised anybody&#x2019;s salary (except maybe the diversity trainers&#x2019;) but it has guaranteed that when your job is outsourced, your culture will be treated with respect.<br>With lacerating prose and exhilarating wit, Michaels takes on the many manifestations of our devotion to diversity, from companies apologizing for slavery, to a college president explaining why there aren&#x2019;t more women math professors, to the codes of conduct in the new &#x201c;humane corporations.&#x201d; Looking at the books we read, the TV shows we watch, and the lawsuits we bring, Michaels shows that diversity has become everyone&#x2019;s sacred cow precisely because it offers a false vision of social justice, one that conveniently costs us nothing. <i>The Trouble with Diversity</i> urges us to start thinking about real justice, about equality instead of diversity. Attacking both the right and the left, it will be the most controversial political book of the year.<b>Walter Benn Michaels</b> is a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#x201c;One of the most influential Americanists of his generation&#x201d; (<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>), he is the author of<i> Our America</i> and has contributed to <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i>, and <i>n+1</i>.

Dave retired after 30 years of teaching writing in college, high school, junior high and grade school. <br> When their son was in the fourth grade, Dave and his wife Lea realized that he was not being given the training they felt he needed and elected to homeschool him in language arts.

Beginning with a direct comparison with humans, dogs, cats, etc., the author describes a humpback's care of her calf, working in other behaviors, more contrasts with fish and basic facts on mammals. Davis's blue-green underwater scenes are nicely varied with changes in light, points of view, and surroundings; his heavy, sculptural style is well suited to the massive whales, and though his land mammals seem stiff, a whale's eye in close-up shines with intelligence. A concluding spread of six species and a diver is the only key to relative sizes (oddly, the featured humpback isn't included). An excellent addition to the Let's-Read-and- Find-Out series.

Plotters quietly dictate the moves of the city's most dangerous criminals, but their existence is little more than legend. Just who are the plotters? And more important, what do they want?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reseng is an assassin. Raised by a cantankerous killer named Old Raccoon in the crime headquarters "The Library," Reseng never questioned anything: where to go, who to kill, or why his home was filled with books that no one ever read. But one day, Reseng steps out of line on a job, toppling a set of carefully calibrated plans. And when he uncovers an extraordinary scheme set into motion by an eccentric trio of young women--a convenience store clerk, her wheelchair-bound sister, and a cross-eyed librarian--Reseng will have to decide if he will remain a pawn or finally take control of the plot. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crackling with action and filled with unforgettable characters, <i>The Plotters</i> is a deeply entertaining thriller that soars with the soul, wit, and lyricism of real literary craft.</p><p>UN-SU KIM was born in 1972 in Busan and is the author of several highly praised novels.

The bullet clicked loudly into the chamber. He glanced around. Other than the tall fir trees reaching for the sky, nothing moved. The forest was silent. No birds took flight, no bugs chirred. Given how still it was out here, the noise of a gunshot would travel a long way. And if people heard it and rushed over? He brushed aside the thought. No point in worrying about that. Gunshots were common out here. They would assume it was poachers hunting wild boar. Who would waste their time hiking this deep into the forest just to investigate a single gunshot? Reseng studied the mountain to the west. The sun was one hand above the ridgeline. He still had time.</p><p>The old man started watering the flowers. Some received a gulp, some just a sip. He tipped the watering can with great ceremony, as if he were serving them tea. Now and then he did a little shoulder shimmy, as if dancing, and gave a petal a brief caress. He gestured at one of the flowers and chuckled. It looked like they were having a conversation. Reseng adjusted the focus again and studied the flower the old man was talking to. It looked familiar. He must have seen it before, but he couldn&#x2019;t remember what it was called. He tried to recall which flower bloomed in October--cosmos? zinnia? chrysanthemum?--but none of the names matched the one he was looking at. Why couldn&#x2019;t he remember? He furrowed his brow and struggled to come up with the name but soon brushed aside that thought, too. It was just a flower--what did it matter?</p><p>A huge black dog strolled over from the other end of the garden and rubbed its head against the old man&#x2019;s thigh. A mastiff, purebred. The same beast Julius Caesar had brought back from his conquest of Britain. The dog the ancient Romans had used to hunt lions and round up wild horses. As the old man gave the dog a pat, it wagged its tail and wound around his legs, getting in his way as he tried to continue his watering. He threw a deflated soccer ball across the garden, and the dog raced after it, tail wagging, while the old man returned to his flowers. Just as before, he gestured at them, greeted them, talked to them. The dog came back immediately, the flattened soccer ball between its teeth. The old man threw the ball farther this time, and the dog raced after it again. The ferocious mastiff that had once hunted lions had been reduced to a clown. And yet the old man and the dog seemed well suited to each other. They repeated the game over and over. Far from getting bored, they looked like they were enjoying it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old man finished his watering and stood up straight, stretching and smiling with satisfaction. Then he turned and looked halfway up the mountain, as if he knew Reseng was there. The old man&#x2019;s smiling face entered Reseng&#x2019;s crosshairs. Did he know the sun was less than a hand above the horizon now? Did he know he would be dead before it dipped below the mountain? Was that why he was smiling? Or maybe he wasn&#x2019;t actually smiling. The old man&#x2019;s face seemed fixed in a permanent grin, like a carved wooden Hahoe mask. Some people just had faces like that--people whose inner feelings you could never guess at, who smiled constantly, even when they were sad or angry.</p><p>Should he pull the trigger now? If he pulled it, he could be back in the city before midnight. He&#x2019;d take a hot bath, down a few beers until he was good and drunk, or put an old Beatles record on the turntable and think about the fun he&#x2019;d soon have with the money on its way into his bank account. Maybe, after this final job, he could change his life. He could open a pizza shop across from a high school, or sell cotton candy in the park. Reseng pictured himself handing armfuls of balloons and cotton candy to children and dozing off under the sun. He really could live that life, couldn&#x2019;t he? The idea of it suddenly seemed so wonderful. But he had to save that thought for after he pulled the trigger. The old man was still alive, and the money was not yet in his account.</p><p>The mountain was swiftly casting its shadow over the old man and his cabin. If Reseng was going to pull the trigger, he had to do it now. The old man had finished watering and would be going back inside any second. The job would get much harder then. Why complicate it? Pull the trigger. Pull it now and get out of here.</p><p>The old man was smiling, and the black dog was running with the soccer ball in its mouth. The old man&#x2019;s face was crystal clear in the crosshairs. He had three deep wrinkles across his forehead, a wart above his right eyebrow, and liver spots on his left cheek. Reseng gazed at where his heart would soon be pierced by a bullet. The old man&#x2019;s sweater looked hand-knit, not factory-made, and was about to be drenched in blood. All he had to do was squeeze the trigger just the tiniest bit, and the firing pin would strike the primer on the 7.62 mm cartridge, igniting the gunpowder inside the brass casing. The explosion would propel the bullet forward along the grooves inside the bore and send it spinning through the air, straight toward the old man&#x2019;s heart. With the high speed and destructive force of the bullet, the old man&#x2019;s mangled organs would explode out the exit wound in his lower back. Just the thought of it made the fine hairs all over Reseng&#x2019;s body stand on end. Holding the life of another human being in the palm of his hand always left him with a funny feeling.</p><p>Pull it.</p><p>Pull it now.</p><p>And yet for some reason, Reseng did not pull the trigger and instead set the rifle down on the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;Now&#x2019;s not the right time,&#x201d; he muttered.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure why it wasn&#x2019;t the right time. Only that there was a right time for everything. A right time for eating ice cream. A right time for going in for a kiss. And maybe it sounded stupid, but there was also a right time for pulling a trigger and a right time for a bullet to the heart. Why wouldn&#x2019;t there be? And if Reseng&#x2019;s bullet happened to be sailing straight through the air toward the old man&#x2019;s heart just as the right moment fortuitously presented itself to him? That would be magnificent. Not that he was waiting for the best possible moment, of course. That auspicious moment might never come. Or it could pass by right under his nose. It occurred to him that he simply didn&#x2019;t want to pull the trigger yet. He didn&#x2019;t know why, but he just didn&#x2019;t. He lit a cigarette. The shadow of the mountain was creeping past the old man&#x2019;s cottage.</p><p>When it turned dark, the old man took the dog inside. The cottage must not have had electricity, because it looked even darker in there. A single candle glowed in the living room, but Reseng couldn&#x2019;t make out the interior well enough through the scope. The shadows of the man and his dog loomed large against a brick wall and disappeared. Now the only way Reseng could kill him from his current position would be if the old man happened to stand directly in the window with the candle in his hand.</p><p>As the sun sank below the ridge, darkness descended on the forest. There was no moon; even objects close at hand were hard to make out. There was only the glimmer of candlelight from the old man&#x2019;s cottage. The darkness was so dense that it made the air seem damp and heavy. Why didn&#x2019;t Reseng just leave? Why linger there in the dark? He wasn&#x2019;t sure. Wait for daybreak, he decided. Once the sun came up, he&#x2019;d fire off a single round--no different from firing at the wooden target he&#x2019;d practiced with for years--and then go home. He put his cigarette butt in his pocket and crawled into the tent. Since there was nothing else to do to pass the time, he ate a packet of army crackers and fell asleep wrapped up in his sleeping bag.</p><p>Reseng was awakened abruptly about two hours later by heavy footsteps in the grass. They were coming straight toward his tent. Three or four irregular thuds. A torso sweeping through tall grass. He couldn&#x2019;t decipher what was coming his way. Could be a wild boar. Or a wildcat. Reseng disengaged the safety and pointed his rifle at the darkness, toward the approaching sound. He couldn&#x2019;t pull the trigger yet. Mercenaries lying in wait had been known to fire into the dark out of fear, without checking their targets, only to discover that they&#x2019;d hit a deer or a police dog or, worse, one of their fellow soldiers lost in the forest while out scouting. They would sob next to the corpse of a brother in arms felled by friendly fire, their beefy, tattooed bodies shaking like a little girl&#x2019;s as they told their commanding officers, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to kill him, I swear.&#x201d; And maybe they really hadn&#x2019;t meant to. Since they&#x2019;d never before had to face their fear of things going bump in the night, the only thing someone with muscles for brains knew how to do was point and shoot into the dark. Reseng waited calmly for whatever was out there to reveal itself. To his surprise, what emerged was the old man and his dog.</p></p><h2>Dead of Night</h2><p><b>Four <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors breach the boundaries of time and reality in these paranormal tales of suspense, intrigue, and out-of-this world passion...</b><br><br>Futuristic lieutenant Eve Dallas ends up in a supernatural showdown with a seductive vampire criminal in J.

In Robb's opener, a courageous female cop with a troubled past clashes with a bloodthirsty, unnaturally powerful mystery man who promises his enthralled victims immortality: charismatic con artist, or much worse? Blayney follows with the story of an enigmatic old coin that transports an American tourist and an oddly aristocratic bartender into a Regency-era adventure. In Langan's, another unsuspecting American time-traveler stumbles into romance with a 15th-century Scottish warlord who believes she's his kidnapped wife. And in McComas's, a bored housewife takes a magic carpet ride to an alternate universe do-over of her marriage. Though they don't always keep a straight face, occasionally tipping from fantasy into farce&#x2014;for instance, a canny medieval Scottish ruler blithely accepting a 21st-century designer pant suit as regulation female barbarian dress&#x2014;such lapses are minor; the biggest fault readers will find is that these intriguing characters are taken away so quickly (especially in Blayney's frustratingly rushed resolution). <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in New York City.<br><br>www.glennkurtz.com<br><br></p><b>Sitting Down</b><br><br>I am sitting down to practice. I open the case and take out my instrument, a classical guitar made from the door of a Spanish church. I strike a tuning fork against my knee and hold it to my ear, then gently pluck an open string. During the night the guitar has drifted out of tune. It tries to pull the tuning fork with it, and I feel the friction of discordant vibrations against my eardrum. I turn the tuning peg slightly, bracing it between my thumb and index finger, until the two sounds converge. Another barely perceptible adjustment, and the vibrations melt together, becoming one. From string to string, I repeat the process, resolving discord with minute twists of my wrist. Then I check high notes against low, middle against outer. Finally I play a chord, sounding all six strings together. Each note rubs the others just right, and the instrument shivers with delight. The feeling is unmistakable, intoxicating. When a guitar is perfectly in tune, its strings, its whole body will resonate in sympathetic vibration, the true concord of well-tuned sounds. It is an ancient, hopeful metaphor, <i>an instrument in tune</i>, speaking of pleasure on earth and order in the cosmos, the fragility of beauty, and the quiver in our longing for love.<br><br>With a metal emery board, then with very fine sandpaper, I file the nails on my right hand. Even the tiniest ridges can catch on a string and make its tone raspy. In 1799 Portuguese guitarist Antonio Abreu suggested trimming the nails with scissors, then smoothing them on a sharpening stone to remove &#x201c;rough edges that might impede the execution of flourishes and lively scales.&#x201d; Some guitarists disagree heatedly with this advice, preferring to play with the fingertips alone. For support, they quote Miguel Fuenllana, who in 1554 stated that &#x201c;to strike with the nails is imperfection. Only the finger, the living thing, can communicate the intention of the spirit.&#x201d; But to my ear, the spirit of music speaks with many voices, and a combination of fingernail and flesh sounds best. I run my thumb over my fingertips. They are as smooth as crystal.<br><br>I shift the guitar into its proper position, settle its weight, and adjust my body to the familiar contours. And then I look around me. My chair is by a window in the living room; my footstool and music stand are in front of me. The window shade is partly drawn so that the San Francisco sunlight falls at my feet but not on my instrument, which would warp in the heat. Outside, people with briefcases and regular jobs are walking down the hill to work. Students are arriving at the school across the street. I listen to their voices and footsteps. Then I take a deep breath, letting them go. I draw myself in. I&#x2019;m alone in the apartment, and my work is here. I begin.<br><br>At first I just play chords. The sounds feel bulky, as do my hands. I concentrate on the simplest task, to play all the notes at precisely the same moment, with one thought, one motion. It takes a few minutes; sometimes, on bad days, it takes all morning. I take my time. But I cannot proceed without this unity of thought, motion, and sound.<br><br>Slowly the effort wakes my fingers. Slowly they warm. As the muscles loosen, I break the chords into arpeggios: the same notes, but now spread out, each with its own place, its own demands. Arpeggios make the fingers of both hands work together in different combinations. I play deliberately, building a triangle of sound&#x2014;fingertip, ear, fingertip&#x2014;until my hands become aware of each other.<br><br>My attention warms and sharpens, and I shape the notes more carefully. I remember now that music is vibration, a disturbance in the air. I remember that music is a kind of breathing, an exchange of energy and excitement. I remember that music is physical, not just in the production of sounds, in the instrumentalist&#x2019;s technique, but as an experience. Making music changes my body, eliciting shivers, sobs, or the desire to dance. I become aware of myself, of these sensations that lie dormant until music brings them out. And in an instant the pleasure, the effort, the ambition and intensity of playing grip me and shake me awake. I feel as if I&#x2019;ve been wandering aimlessly until now, as if all the time I&#x2019;m not practicing, I&#x2019;m a sleepwalker.<br><br>I calm myself and concentrate. Give the sounds time, let the instrument vibrate. I have to hear the sounds I want before I make them, and I have to let the sounds be what they are. Then I have to hear the difference between what I have in mind and what comes from the strings.<br><br>It&#x2019;s easy to get carried away. The grandeur, the depth and beauty of music are always present in the practice room. Holding the guitar, I feel music&#x2019;s power at my fingertips, as if I might pluck a string and change the world. For centuries people believed that music was the force that moved the planets. Looking into the night sky, astronomers saw the harmony of heaven, and philosophers heard the music of the spheres. Musicians were prophets then, and according to Cicero the most talented might gain entry to heaven while still alive simply &#x201c;by imitating this harmony on stringed instruments.&#x201d; Every artist must sometimes believe that art is the doorway to the divine. Perhaps it is. But it&#x2019;s dangerous for a musician to philosophize instead of practicing. The grandeur of music, to be heard, must be played. When I hold the guitar, I may aspire to play perfect harmonies. But first I have to play well.<br><br>I bring myself back to the work at hand. I listen to the strings, while testing fine gradations in the angle, speed, and strength of my touch. I vary the dynamics and articulation, vary the intensity and color of the notes. If I am to play well, I must gather the guitar&#x2019;s many voices, let each one sing out. After a few more minutes of arpeggios, my fingers grow warm and capable. The notes are clear and distinct, and I play the simple chords again, very softly at first, then louder and more urgently. Again, softly, then filling, expanding, releasing. Once more, until gradually the sounds from the instrument near what I hear in my head.<br><br>Listening, drawing sound, motion, and thought together, I find my concentration. My imagination opens and reaches out. And in that reaching I begin to recognize myself. My hands feel like my hands and not the mitts I usually walk around with. I recognize my instrument&#x2019;s tone; this is how I sound, for now. I recognize my body; I feel alert and able. I feel like a musician again, a classical guitarist. I feel ready to work, ready to play.<br>&#x201c;For the past eighty years I have started each day in the same manner,&#x201d; wrote the cellist Pablo Casals in his memoir, <i>Joys and Sorrows</i>. &#x201c;I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues of Bach. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being.&#x201d;<br><br>Try to describe your experience of music, and you&#x2019;ll quickly reach the limits of words. Music carries us away, and we grope for the grandest terms in our vocabulary just to hint at the marvel of the flight, the incredible marvel, the wonder. &#x201c;Each day,&#x201d; Casals continues, &#x201c;it is something new, fantastic, and unbelievable.&#x201d; I imagine him leaning forward in excitement, a round-faced bald man in his eighties, gesturing with his hands, then meeting my eyes to see if I&#x2019;ve understood. Fantastic and unbelievable. The words say little. But yes, I think I understand.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sitting down to practice, and like Casals, I&#x2019;m grasping for words to equal my experience. Alone in the practice room, I hold my instrument silently. Every day it is the same task, yet something new. I delve down, seeking what hides waiting in the notes, what lies dormant in myself that music brings to life. I close my eyes and listen for the unheard melody in what I&#x2019;ve played a hundred times before, the unsuspected openings.<br><br>What are the tones, the terms, that unlock music&#x2019;s power, the pleasure and profundity we experience in listening? I begin to play, leaning forward excitedly and grasping for the right notes, my whole body alive with aspiration. Sounds ring out, ripening for a moment in the air, then dying away. I play the same notes again, reaching for more of the sweetness, the bittersweetness they contain and express. And again the sounds ring out, float across the room, and fall still. Each day, with every note, practicing is the same task, this essential human gesture&#x2014;reaching out for an ideal, for the grandeur of what you desire, and feeling it slip through your fingers.<br><br>Practicing music&#x2014;practicing anything we really love&#x2014;we are always at the limit of words, striving for something just beyond our ability to express. Sometimes, when we speak of this work, therefore, we make this the goal, emphasizing the pleasure of reaching out. Practicing, writes Yehudi Menuhin, is &#x201c;the search for ever greater joy in movement and expression. This is what practice is really about.&#x201d; But frequently we experience a darker, harsher mood, aware in each moment of what slips away unattained. Then pleasure seems like nourishment for the journey, but it is not what carries us forward. When musicians speak of this experience, they often stress the labor, warning how difficult a path it is, how lonesome and demanding. The great Spanish guitarist Andr�s Segovia cautioned that &#x201c;it is impossible to feign mastery of an instrument, however skillful the impostor may be.&#x201d; But to attain mastery, if it is possible at all, requires &#x201c;the stern discipline of lifelong practice.&#x201d; For the listener, Segovia says, music might seem effortless or divine. But for the musician it is the product of supreme effort and devotion, the feast at the end of the season.<br><br>Like every practicing musician, I know both the joy and the hard labor of practice. <i>To hear these sounds emerging from my instrument! And to hear them more clearly, more beautifully in my head than my fingers can ever seem to grasp.</i> Together this pleasure in music and the discipline of practice engage in an endless tussle, a kind of romance. The sense of joy justifies the labor; the labor, I hope, leads to joy. This, at least, is the bargain I quietly make with myself each morning as I sit down. If I just do my work, then pleasure, mastery will follow. Even the greatest artists must make the same bargain. &#x201c;I was obliged to work hard,&#x201d; Johann Sebastian Bach is supposed to have said. And I want so much to believe him when he promises that &#x201c;whoever is equally industrious will succeed just as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet as I wrap my arms around the guitar to play, I also hear another voice whispering in my ears. &#x201c;Whatever efforts we may make,&#x201d; warned Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his 1767 <i>Dictionary of Music</i>, &#x201c;we must still be born to the art, otherwise our works can never mount above the insipid.&#x201d; In every musician&#x2019;s mind lurks the fear that practicing is merely busywork, that you are either born to your instrument or you are an impostor. Trusting Bach and Segovia, I cling to the belief that my effort will, over time, yield mastery. But this faith sometimes seems na�ve, merely a wish. &#x201c;The capacity for melody is a gift,&#x201d; asserted Igor Stravinsky. &#x201c;This means that it is not within our power to develop it by study.&#x201d; Practice all you want, Rousseau and Stravinsky say, but you will never become a musician if you don&#x2019;t start out one. Perhaps practice will carry me only so far. Perhaps, as Oscar Wilde put it, &#x201c;only mediocrities develop.&#x201d;<br><br>I shake out my hands. Outside on the street, the morning commute is over. The workday has begun; school is in session. Only tourists pass by my window now, lumbering up the hill in search of Lombard Street, &#x201c;the crookedest street in the world.&#x201d; I walk down this tourist attraction all the time, a pretty, twisting street festooned with flowers. Now, from my chair, I watch a family cluster around a map, Mom, Dad, and two red-haired teenage boys, each pointing in a different direction. They&#x2019;re just a block from their destination, but they don&#x2019;t know it, lost within sight of their goal. I feel that way every day.<br><br>Practicing is striving; practicing is a romance. But practicing is also a risk, a test of character, a threat of deeply personal failure. I warm up my hands and awaken my ears and imagination, developing skill to equal my experience. I listen and concentrate in an effort to make myself better. Yet every day I collide with my limits, the constraints of my hands, my instrument, and my imagination. Each morning when I sit down, I&#x2019;m bewildered by a cacophony of voices, encouraging and dismissive, joyous and harsh, each one a little tyrant, each one insisting on its own direction. And I struggle to harmonize them, to find my way between them, uncertain whether this work is worth it or a waste of my time.<br><br>Everything I need to make music is here, my hands, my instrument, my imagination, and these notes. For most of their lives Segovia, Casals, Bach, and Stravinsky were also just men sitting alone in a room with these same raw materials, looking out the window at people on the street. Like me, they must at times have wondered how to grasp the immensity of music&#x2019;s promise in a few simple notes, how to hold fast to their devotion against a cutting doubt that would kill it.</p><h2>Hidden in Plain Sight: The Revelation of the Son&#39;s of Yah in America</h2><p>Due to the forced migrations during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans have been displaced from their homelands, language, and culture. Because of conquest, colonialism, and history written in jealousy, the identity of this displaced people has become a topic of controversial discussion. This African Diaspora has been the vehicle for stealing and recasting the historical people of the land, while also veiling the truth of their pre-slavery existence. After nearly 400 years of the calculated misuse of religion and removal of cultural markers, Hidden in Plain Sight seeks to provoke thought on religion, racism, and cultural appropriation in order to assist in rebuilding the foundation that has been destroyed by systemic oppression. The current condition of &#x201c;Blacks&#x201d; in America is an obvious cause for concern, but very few seek to tell the unbridled truth about the origin of this condition, as well as those who have contributed to its perpetuation. This book tackles the echoing questions of &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t we just move on?&#x201d; Is it truly necessary to know the past in order to change the course of the future? Can there ever be solidarity amongst humanity? and if so what does that look like?

Though there were many ancient Greek and Latin works concerning food, this collection of recipes is unique. The editors suggest that it is a survival from many such collections maintained by working cooks and that the attribution to Apicius the man (a real-life Roman noble of the 2nd century AD), is a mere literary convention. There have been many English translations of this work (and, abroad, some important academic editions) but none reliable since 1958 (Flower and Rosenbaum). In any case, this edition and translation has revisited all surviving manuscripts in Europe and the USA and proposes many new readings and interpretations.

Optical illusions abound in Wick's stunning color photographs--tricking the brain into pursuing phantom images. In the opening spread, entitled "First Impressions," we see a white glob of smashed clay, with sunken impressions of objects such as buttons, screws, and chess pieces. But when you turn the page upside down, the clay impressions seem to pop out! In the second spread, "Mirror Magic," you see a collection of objects such as a billiard ball, a die, and a wooden block in the shape of the number 4. The billiard ball, also a number 4, is reflected backward in the mirror, but the block number 4 is not. Why not? Fortunately, readers can flip to the back of the book, where Wick explains the illusions in his refreshingly straightforward and concise manner. <p> Brilliantly composed photographs of simple props, expert lighting, and myriad mirrors baffle us page after page: a "Tricky Triangle" that has a peculiar twist; a bogus box; Escher-like visual deceptions; and more. Wick explains, "As much as possible, the photographs are designed to challenge readers to compare <i>true perceptions</i> (the objects as they really exist) with <i>false perceptions</i> (the illusions) as a way to cultivate visual logic skills and to sharpen powers of observation." This visually maddening, mind-bending book will challenge and entertain even the keenest young observers. Is it all smoke and mirrors? Most certainly.

In his classic work <i>Frames of Mind</i>, he undermined the common notion that intelligence is a single capacity that every human being possesses to a greater or lesser extent. With <i>Creating Minds</i>, Gardner gives us a path breaking view of creativity, along with riveting portraits of seven figures who each reinvented an area of human endeavor. <br>Using as a point of departure his concept of seven "intelligences," ranging from musical intelligence to the intelligence involved in understanding oneself, Gardner examines seven extraordinary individuals -- Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, Martha Graham, and Mahatma Gandhi -- each an outstanding exemplar of one kind of intelligence. Understanding the nature of their disparate creative breakthroughs not only sheds light on their achievements but also helps to elucidate the "modern era" -- the times that formed these creators and which they in turn helped to define. While focusing on the moment of each creator's most significant breakthrough, Gardner discovers patterns crucial to our understanding of the creative process. <br>Creative people feature unusual combinations of intelligence and personality, and Gardner delineates the indispensable role of the circumstances in which an individual's creativity can thrive -- and how extraordinary creativity almost always carries with it extraordinary human costs.</p><p><b>Howard Gardner</b> is the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Senior Director of Harvard Project Zero. The author of more than twenty books and the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship and twenty-one honorary degrees, he lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.It takes chutzpah to come up with a scheme for analyzing creativity--especially in subjects already exhaustively examined. But for psychologist and MacArthur fellow Gardner (Harvard Graduate School of Education), it amounts to a natural progression from his earlier dissections of intelligence: Frames of Mind and Multiple Intelligences argued that, instead of a generalized intelligence, there are at least seven varieties (musical, logical-mathematical, visual, etc.). Here, Gardner chooses prototypes of each variety and provides capsule biographies and analyses along such themes as the child versus the adult creator, and the creator in relation to others and to the work. Gardner finds sufficient commonalities among his seven types of intelligence to provide a synthesis: an ``exemplary creator'' (E.C.). This individual (whom Gardner calls ``she'') is somewhat ``marginal'' in the social milieu, born into a reasonably comfortable family away from the creative center (Picasso and Stravinsky moved to Paris, Freud to Vienna...). There may not be much family love and affection but there may be a devoted nurse or a role model. The child is strong-minded and exhibits ability but isn't necessarily a prodigy. She moves into a decade of mastery of the domain and accomplishes a critical breakthrough that may include the affirmation of a few chosen peers (Picasso and Braque; Stravinsky and Diaghilev). Second and third breakthroughs may develop in successive decades until old age takes its toll. The E.C. retains childlike characteristics, including self- centeredness, even exploitation of others (Stravinsky's litigiousness; Picasso's sadism). E.C.s may make Faustian bargains, often leading to disastrous domestic life and parenthood. One can come up with counterexamples, and argue that there might be Western/20th-century biases at work here. But one has to hand it to Gardner for offering some provocative post-Eriksonian thoughts on creativity that are a lot more stimulating than those that measure creativity according to the ``100 uses of a safety pin'' school of thought. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He was also known as perhaps the greatest genius of the English Renaissance possibly the best-educated man of his day and also a major theorist of classical learning for Christians. The man who wrote the seminal words &#39;The end then of Learning is to repair the ruines of our first Parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to imitate him, to be like him . . . &#39; (Of Education, 1644) argues across all his voluminous writings that the purpose of education is soul work for virtue as opposed to information gathering for profit. In this book, Milton scholar Professor Grant Horner from The Master&#39;s College examines the poet&#39;s powerful vision of a Christian and classical education. Trained at Duke University by Stanley Fish, the world&#39;s most influential Miltonist, Horner approaches the text as a Christian educator himself, bringing the complex seventeenth-century texts into modern light for practical application. Addressing questions such as how to handle pagan texts, how to develop a theology of aesthetics, and why we must grapple with the relationship between pagan wisdom and scripture, this book will serve as a thorough and readable introduction to the complex thought of one of the Puritan intellectual giants.</p><p>Grant Horner has a BA in English from York College and an MA in English Renaissance Studies from the University of Alabama. His doctoral studies include work at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University, and he is a PhD candidate in Renaissance and Reformation Studies at Claremont Graduate University. He is a professor at The Master&#39;s College, where he specializes in Renaissance and Reformation Studies and twice has been named Professor of the Year. He teaches courses on Renaissance literature, film studies, Shakespeare, Milton, Calvin, comedy, Latin, critical theory, western art history, and epic literature.As we continue in our day with the task of rebuilding classical Christian education, one of the things we absolutely must do is reexamine the thought of some of the giants produced in times past by an earlier iteration of that same kind of education. And that is exactly what Grant Horner has done in this fine treatment of Milton. Highly recommended. --Douglas Wilson</p><h2>A Day in the Life: the Empty Bowl &amp; Diamond Sutras</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction. Asian &amp; Asian American Studies. Religion and Spirituality. Buddhism. Translated by Red Pine. Empty Bowl is proud to present Red Pine's newest offering: two sutras that record a day in the life of the Buddha when the Buddha was teaching the Prajnaparamita, the teaching that formed the basis of Buddhism's Mahayana path. Not only are they among the shortest Prajnaparamita texts, they're connected and read as if they span the events of a single day. In the "Empty Bowl Sutra," which appears here in English for the first time, the Buddha's disciples' question Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, on his way to town to beg for food, and he responds with the teaching of emptiness--that anything we might think of as real is illusory and its "thingness" based on nothing more than our own projections. In the "Diamond Sutra," the translation of which has benefitted from recently discovered Sanskrit copies, the Buddha returns from his own begging round and tells his disciples what results when they combine this teaching with the vow to liberate others. In using the most significant events in his own career as an example, the Buddha presents one of the earliest accounts of how buddhas become buddhas.<br><br>Both sutras are presented together in a 5"X7" chapbook, saddle stitched, with an introduction but minimum of notes so that readers can experience the force of these texts uninterrupted and in a convenient hand-held, open-page format.</p><p>Bill Porter, who translated under the name Red Pine, was born in Van Nuys, California on October 3, 1943, and grew up in Northern Idaho, where his parents moved in 1954. After a tour of duty in the US Army 1964-67, he attended UC Santa Barbara and majored in anthropology. In 1970, he entered graduate school at Columbia University and studied anthropology with a faculty that included Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. While he was living in New York, he became interested in Buddhism, and in 1972 he left America and moved to a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. After more than three years with the monks and nuns, he struck out on his own and supported himself by teaching English and later by working as a journalist at English-language radio stations in Taiwan and Hong Kong. During this time, he married a Chinese woman, with whom he has two children, and he began working on translations of Chinese poetry and Buddhist texts. In 1993, he returned to America so that his children could learn English, and he has lived ever since in Port Townsend, Washington. His translations of texts dealing with Chinese history, culture, poetry, and religion have been honored with a number of awards, including two NEA translation fellowships, a PEN translation award, the inaugural Asian Literature Award of the American Literary Translators Association, a Guggenheim Fellowship, which he received to support work on a book based on a pilgrimage to the graves and homes of China's greatest poets of the past, which was published under the title <em>Finding Them Gone</em> in January of 2016, and more recently in 2018 the Thornton Wilder Prize for Translation bestowed by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><h2>Requiem and Poem without a Hero</h2><p><p>With this edition of <i>Requiem and Poem without a Hero,</i> Swallow Press presents two of Anna Akhmatova's best-known works, ones that represent the poet at full maturity, and that most trenchantly process the trauma she and others experienced living under Stalin's regime.<br><br>Akhmatova began the three-decade process of writing Requiem in 1935 after the arrests of her son, Lev Gumilev, and her third husband. The autobiographical fifteen-poem cycle primarily chronicles a mother's wait-lining up outside Leningrad Prison every day for seventeen months-for news of her son's fate. But from this limbo, Akhmatova expresses and elevates the collective grief for all the thousands vanished under the regime, and for those left behind to speculate about their loved ones' fates. Poem without a Hero was similarly written over a long period. It takes as its focus the transformation of Akhmatova's beloved city of St. Petersburg-historically a seat of art and culture-into Leningrad. Taken together, these works plumb the foremost themes for which Akhmatova is known and revered. When Ohio University Press published D. M. Thomas's translations in 1976, it was the first time they had appeared in English. Under Thomas's stewardship, Akhmatova's words ring clear as a bell. </p></p><p><p><b>Anna Akhmatova</b> (1889&#x2013;1966) is an iconic figure of twentieth-century Russian literature and one of her era&#x2019;s great poets.

It sounded as if a dozen express trains were about to hit the shed. I rolled over in my blanket, trying to get out of the way, and was aware of a blaze of orange, lighting up boxes and bits of old farm equipment and tackle. An ancient rusting tractor looked briefly like an overgrown insect.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was that, Laurie?&#x201d; Andy asked. I could see him sitting up, between me and the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both light and sound faded and died. A dog started barking&#x2014;deep-throated, a Labrador maybe. I got up and walked to the window, banging my shin on something in the dark. It was dark outside, too, moon and stars hidden by cloud. A light came on in the farmhouse, which was a couple of hundred meters away, just below the ridge.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not raining. What was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t someone at the camp say something about an artillery range on the moor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nowhere near here, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever they were firing could have gone astray.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rubbing my shin, I said, &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t sound like a shell. And a shell wouldn&#x2019;t produce fireworks like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A rocket, maybe.&#x201d; He yawned loudly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all quiet now, anyway. No sweat. Go to sleep. We&#x2019;ve a long trek in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood by the window for a while. Eventually the light in the house went out: the farmer presumably took the same view as Andy. In the pitch black I felt my way to the pile of straw which served as a bed. This was less fun than it had seemed the previous evening; there was little protection from the hardness of the earth floor, and once awake I knew all about the aches in my muscles.<br> <br>Andy was already asleep. I blamed him for our being here&#x2014;for volunteering us into the orienteering expedition in the first place, and then for insisting on a left fork which had taken us miles out of our way. It had looked as though we would have to spend the night on the moor, but we&#x2019;d come across this isolated farm as dusk was thickening. The rules were not to ask for help, so we&#x2019;d settled down in the shed.<br> <br>I thought my aches, and resenting Andy, would keep me awake, but I was dead tired. We had set out early from summer camp, and it had been a long day&#x2019;s slog. Drifting into sleep again, I was half aware of another explosion, but it was a distant one, and I was too weary really to wake up&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t even be sure I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Andy woke me with the gray light of dawn filtering in. He said, &#x201c;Listen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d;<br> <br>I struggled into wakefulness. The noise was coming from the direction of the farmhouse, but further away, a succession of loud thumpings, heavy and mechanical.<br> <br>&#x201c;Farm machinery?&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Listening more carefully, I didn&#x2019;t either. The thumps came at intervals of a second or less, and they were getting nearer. There was even a sensation of the ground shaking under me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something heading this way,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Something big, by the sound of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>We crowded together at the small window of the shed. The sun hadn&#x2019;t risen, but to the east the farmhouse was outlined against a pearly sky. Smoke from a chimney rose almost straight: farmers were early risers. It looked like a good day for the trek back to camp. Then I saw what was coming into view on the other side of the house.<br> <br>The top appeared first, an enormous gray-green hemispherical capsule, flat side down, which seemed to be floating ponderously in midair. But it wasn&#x2019;t floating: a weird stiltlike leg moved in a vast arc across the sky and planted itself just to the right of the farmhouse. As it crashed down a second leg appeared, passing over the house and landing between it and the shed. I could see a third leg, too, which if it followed suit would come to ground close to us, if not on top of us. But at that point, it stopped. The gigantic object, more than twenty meters high, stood straddling the house.<br> <br>A band of bright green glassy panels ran horizontally along the side of the capsule. It produced an effect that was a cross between multiple staring eyes and a grinning mouth. It wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s making a film.&#x201d; Andy&#x2019;s voice was unsteady. I turned to him and he looked as scared as I felt. &#x201c;That must be it. A science-fiction movie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So where are the cameras?&#x201d; I felt my voice was coming out wrong, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;They probably have to get it into position first.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know whether he believed it. I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Something was moving beneath the capsule, curling and twisting and stretching out. It was like an elephant&#x2019;s trunk, or a snake, except that it was silvery and metallic. It corkscrewed down towards the roof of the house and brushed lightly against it. Then it moved to the chimney stack and grasped it with a curling tip. Bricks sprayed like confetti, and we heard them crashing onto the slates.<br> <br>I was shivering. Inside the house a woman screamed. A door at the back burst open, and a man in shirt and trousers came out. He stared up at the machine looming above him and started running. Immediately a second tentacle uncurled, this time fast and purposeful. The tip caught him before he&#x2019;d gone ten meters, fastened round his waist, and plucked him from the ground. He was screaming, too, now.<br> <br>The tentacle lifted him up in front of the row of panels, and his screams turned to muffled groaning. After a few moments the tentacle twisted back on itself. A lenslike opening appeared at the base of the capsule; it carried him towards it and thrust him through. I thought of someone holding a morsel of food on a fork before popping it into his mouth, and felt sick.<br> <br>His groans ended as the tentacle withdrew, and the opening closed. The woman in the house had also become quiet; but the silence was even more frightening. Resting on its spindly legs, the machine had the look of an insect digesting its prey. I remembered my glimpse of the derelict tractor in the night; this insect was as tall as King Kong.<br> <br>For what seemed a long time, nothing happened. The thing didn&#x2019;t stir, and there was no sound or movement from the house. All was still; not even a bird chirped. The tentacle hovered in midair, motionless and rigid.<br> <br>When, after a minute or so, the tentacle did move, it raised itself higher, as though making a salute. For a second or two it hung in the air, before slamming down violently against the roof. Slates scattered, and rafters showed through a gaping hole. The woman started to shriek again.<br> <br>Methodically the tentacle smashed the house, and as methodically picked over the ruins, like a scavenger going through a garbage can. The shrieking stopped, leaving just the din of demolition. A second tentacle set to work alongside the first, and a third joined them.<br> <br>They probed deep into the rubble, lifting things up to the level of the panels. Most of what was picked up was dropped or tossed aside&#x2014;chairs, a sideboard, a double bed, a bathtub dangling the metal pipes from which it had been ripped. A few were taken inside: I noticed an electric kettle and a television set.<br> <br>At last it was over, and dust settled as the tentacles retracted under the capsule.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we ought to get away from here,&#x201d; Andy said. His voice was so low I could hardly hear him.<br> <br>&#x201c;How far do you think it can see?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But if we dodge out quickly, and get round the back . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I gripped his arm. Something was moving at the base of the rubble that had been the farmhouse: a black dog wriggled free and started running across the farmyard. It covered about ten meters before a tentacle arrowed towards it. The dog was lifted, howling, in front of the panels, and held there. I thought it was going to be taken inside, as the man had been; instead the tentacle flicked it away. Briefly the dog was a black blur against the dawn light, then a crumpled silent heap.<br> <br>The sick feeling was back, and one of my legs was trembling. I thought of my first sight of the Eiffel Tower, the summer my mother left and Ilse came to live with us&#x2014;and my panicky feeling over the way it stretched so far up into the sky. This was as if the Eiffel Tower had moved&#x2014;had smashed a house to bits and swallowed up a man . . . tossed a dog to its death the way you might throw away an apple core.<br> <br>Time passed more draggingly than I ever remembered. I looked at my watch, and the display read 05:56. I looked again after what seemed like half an hour, and it said 05:58. The sky was getting lighter and there was first a point of gold, then a sliver, finally a disk of sun beyond the ruins of the house. I looked at my watch again. It was 06:07.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Look!&#x201d;<br> <br>The legs hadn&#x2019;t moved but the capsule was tilting upwards and beginning a slow rotation. The row of panels was moving to the left. Soon we might be out of the field of vision and have a chance of sneaking away. But as the rotation continued, a second row of panels came into view. It could see all round.<br> <br>When it had traversed a hundred and eighty degrees, the rotation stopped. After that, nothing happened. The monster just stayed there, fixed, as leaden minutes crawled by.<br> <br>The first plane came over soon after eight. A fighter made two runs, east to west and then west to east at a lower level. The thing didn&#x2019;t move. A quarter of an hour later a helicopter circled round, taking photographs, probably. It was nearly midday before the armored brigade arrived. Tanks and other tracked vehicles drew up on open farmland, and, in the bit of the farm lane in view, we could see an important-looking car and some trucks, including a TV van, all keeping a careful distance.<br> <br>After that, nothing happened for another long time. We learned later this was the period in which our side was attempting to make radio contact, trying different frequencies without result. Andy got impatient, and again suggested making a run for it, towards the tanks.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;The fact it hasn&#x2019;t moved doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t. Remember the dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do. It might also decide to smash this hut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if we run, and it starts something and the army starts something back . . . we&#x2019;re likely to catch it from both sides.&#x201d;<br> <br>He reluctantly accepted that. &#x201c;Why hasn&#x2019;t the army done something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think they ought to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, not just sit there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose they don&#x2019;t want to rush things. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I broke off as an engine started up, followed by a rumble of tracks. We ran to the window. A single tank was moving forward. It had a pole attached to its turret, and a white flag fluttering from the pole.<br> <br>The tank lurched across the field and stopped almost directly beneath the capsule. The engine switched off, and I heard a sparrow chirruping outside the shed. Then, unexpectedly, there was a burst of classical music.<br> <br>I asked, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that coming from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the tank, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they want to demonstrate that we&#x2019;re civilized, not barbarians. It&#x2019;s that bit from a Beethoven symphony, isn&#x2019;t it&#x2014;the one that&#x2019;s sung as a European anthem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Andy pointed. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br> <br>The machine was showing signs of movement. Beneath the capsule a tentacle uncurled. It extended down towards the tank and began waving gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it doing?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s keeping time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The weird thing was, he was right; it was moving in rhythm with the music. A second tentacle emerged, dipped, and brushed against the turret. As though it were getting the hang of things, the first tentacle started moving faster, in a more positive beat. The second felt its way round the tank from front to rear, then made a second approach from the side, moving over it and probing underneath. The tip dug down, rocking the tank slightly, and reemerged to complete an embrace. The tank rocked more violently as it was lifted, at first just clear of the ground, then sharply upward.<br> <br>Abruptly the music gave way to the stridence of machine-gun fire. Tracer bullets flamed against the sky. The tank rose in the tentacle&#x2019;s grip until it was level with the panels. It hung there, spitting out sparks.<br> <br>But pointlessly; at that angle the tracers were scouring empty sky. And they stopped abruptly, as the tentacle tightened its grip; armorplate crumpled like tinfoil. For two or three seconds it squeezed the tank, before uncurling and letting it drop. The tank fell like a stone, landing on its nose and balancing for an instant before toppling over. There was a furrow along the side where it had been compressed to less than half its original width.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;That was a Challenger.&#x201d; He sounded shaken, but not as shaken as I felt. I could still see that terrible careless squeeze, the tank dropped like a toffee paper.<br> <br>When I looked out again, one of the tentacles had retracted, but the other was waving still, and still in the rhythm it had picked up from the music. I wanted to run&#x2014;somewhere, anywhere, not caring what came next&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t move a muscle. I wondered if anyone in the tank had survived. I didn&#x2019;t see how they could have.<br> <br>Then, unexpectedly and shatteringly, there was a roar of aircraft as the fighter-bombers, which had been on standby, whooshed in from the south, launching rockets as they came. Of the six they fired, two scored hits. I saw the long spindly legs shatter, the capsule tilt and sway and crash. It landed between the ruins of the farmhouse and the wrecked tank, with an impact that shook the shed.<br> <br>I could hardly believe how quickly it was over&#x2014;and how completely. But there was the capsule lying on its side, with broken bits of leg sticking out. As we stared, a second wave of fighter-bombers swooped in, pulverizing the remains.</p><h2>Journey of Your Soul: A Channel Explores the Michael Teachings</h2><p>Even at birth, everyone is unique. Can heredity alone account for the complex differences in people's temperaments and styles? The Michael teachings, an extraordinary body of channeled work, propose that we are each unique souls who deliberately take on a specific combination of traits to give us the experiences we seek. In this fascinating book, Shepherd Hoodwin expertly discusses these teachings from his vantage point as a Michael channel.<br><br>"Michael" is a group of souls who teach that we are eternal beings journeying from the Tao and back again in an adventure of exploration and creativity. Each step along the way, we make choices that shape our experience. For example, after committing to a series of lifetimes, we choose one of seven roles, or soul types: <i>server, priest, artisan, sage, warrior, king,</i> or <i>scholar.</i><br><br>These teachings address many age-old questions, such as "How did we become who we are?" "Why are we here?" "Where are we going?" and "How does the universe work?" In addition,<i> Journey of Your Soul </i>sheds light on the channeling process itself, answering questions such as "How does channeling work?" "Why do different channels receive conflicting information?" and "What does it take to become a channel?" Hoodwin shows us that it is possible, and indeed beneficial, to engage all parts of the human consciousness. His unique analytical approach to channeling will help readers gain a firm intellectual understanding of what is involved.<br><br>In his foreword, Jon Klimo, PhD, author of <i>Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources</i>, says, "Shepherd Hoodwin has given us one of the best books to date about the phenomenon of channeling.<i> Journey of Your Soul </i>may well also be the best of the Michael books due to its clarity, thoroughness, and detail, and thanks to the fact that the author, an exceptionally clearheaded Michael channel himself, brings real integrity and authenticity to our understanding of Michael in particular and to the channeling process in general."</p><p>Shepherd Hoodwin&nbsp;has been channeling since 1986. He specializes in the Michael teachings, and practices healing, mediumship, past-life readings and therapy, counseling, and coaches others to channel.

In addition, we all have our own experience of reality and ways of describing it. There is no right and wrong in this regard, only infinite facets of truth. We do have much to learn from each other, and those on higher planes usually have more experience, greater resources of information, and a larger perspective than we do on the physical plane. However, their counsel is more accurately viewed as coming from loving friends than from a deity. No one is more "God" than anyone else. We are each responsible for ourselves. We experience more growth if we don't do things merely because we think someone else, incarnate or not, told us to. It is well to examine what we hear others say with appreciation and respect, but we don't always hear what is actually meant, for one thing. More importantly, no one knows us better than we know ourselves, at least potentially. We must make our own decisions and mistakes, and form our own understanding, if we are to learn to guide the course of our lives wisely. Besides, true teachers don't tell people what to do. They give greater perspective and understanding so that their students can make well-informed choices. Beware of those who issue orders, or who are certain that they know what's best for someone else, even if they are being channeled from a higher plane. Just because material is channeled does not mean that it is appropriate or a fully realized expression of truth.</p><p> RECOGNIZING TRUTH</p><p> Channeled material, like everything else, must be interpreted through the understanding of the hearer. Sometimes we draw conclusions or make associations that are not valid, or we simply misunderstand. I am sometimes amazed at what clients say Michael said. The truth is precise; it is as important to hear what is not being said as what is. The ability to recognize truth is crucial. Truth is always associated with love. It has a certain feel about it. It is not necessarily comfortable, but it is penetrating and ultimately liberating. Often the truth or value of channeled material isn't fully apparent until later. It may seem at first to be deceptively simple or general. If we have that experience with something channeled for us, we have nothing to lose by living with it a while and seeing if it looks different later. One client told me that after her session, she wasn't particularly impressed, but two months later, she listened to her tapes and couldn't believe that Michael had said what they did; it was almost as if she hadn't heard it the first time. This is a common reaction. In my brochure for new clients, Michael says: "You will get the most out of this session if you review the material in a week or two. It's hard for so much new input to soak in the first time. A defense against overload is to make it seem less than it is. This is normal, but often, our students find their channeling to be far more meaningful weeks or even months later. It is the mark of a good teacher (and we aspire to this) to give what the student is almost but not quite ready to hear. That way, we promote growth. Obviously, the material becomes more meaningful when the student is actually ready." Our Western society's model of truth is based on polarity: something is either true or it isn't, and if it's true, something else must therefore be false. In my experience, two statements that seem contradictory can both be true, or at least, mostly true. I have sought to demonstrate that throughout this book. Michael speaks of personal, world, and universal truths. That concept points out that something may be true for an individual or even many individuals, but not be true for everyone in the world, let alone in the universe. Gravity, for instance, is different everywhere on the planet, partly because of varying distances from the earth's core. If we didn't know that and saw two different measurements of earth's gravity reported, we would probably assume that one report was wrong. When we don't have enough information, when we lack "bridge information," we can tend to be judgmental and simplistic in our views. Truth is infinite, and is therefore vast enough to hold an infinite number of facets. Someone said that the measure of an idea's greatness is the degree to which its opposite is also true. If there are poles of absolute truth and absolute falsehood, there is a long continuum in between, the infinite shades of gray between white and black. But more likely, absolute truth and absolute falsehood do not exist in the dimensional universe - only in the Tao is absolute truth. Pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, refuses to be rounded off - it just keeps going into infinity: 3.14159265.... We do round off pi so that we can work with it - that is a convenience, but it is not the whole truth. With any spiritual teaching, we are working with rounded-off truth, because we cannot work directly with the whole truth - it's too big. I discussed models of reality in the Preface. We have no choice but to work with models. What else do we have? However, a good model connects us to the infinite truth that it models, and although that cannot be fathomed, it can be felt. The more true we are to the truth of ourselves, the better we can recognize truth in models.</p><p> THE LARGER PERSPECTIVE</p><p> We are in the midst of a planetary transformation. There are many nonphysical beings who are assisting with it, whether we know it or not. Channeling is a means of consciously working with them. They are often as gratified to make the connection with us as we are with them. Used in a responsible way, channeling can be an important tool in our personal and collective growth. Whether or not we call ourselves channels, it is becoming more and more essential that each of us develop our inner connections with the larger universe if we are to move creatively with the changes occurring.</p></p><h2>The Secret Child: A gripping novel of family secrets that will leave you in tears</h2><p><p>&#x2018;<b>I could not put this book down all day long...</b> What a layered, poignant, deep, beautiful story. <b>Simply wonderful</b> writing.

Criminology Goes to the Movies connects with ways in which students are already thinking criminologically through engagements with popular culture, encouraging them to use the everyday world as a vehicle for theorizing and understanding both crime and perceptions of criminality. The first work to bring a systematic and sophisticated criminological perspective to bear on crime films, Rafter and Brown&#x2019;s book provides a fresh way of looking at cinema, using the concepts and analytical tools of criminology to uncover previously unnoticed meanings in film, ultimately making the study of criminological theory more engaging and effective for students while simultaneously demonstrating how theories of crime circulate in our mass-mediated worlds. The result is an illuminating new way of seeing movies and a delightful way of learning about criminology. </p><br><p> Instructor's Guide</p></p><p><p></p><p><b>Nicole Rafter</b> was Professor Emeritus of Criminology at Northeastern University.

The greatest naval battle in history raged around him, its outcome hanging in the balance as the U.S. desperately searched for its first major victory of the Second World War.

He released three bombs at the last possible instant, then desperately pulled out of his gut-wrenching 9-g dive. As his plane leveled out just above the roiling Pacific Ocean, Dusty&#x2019;s perfectly placed bombs struck the carrier&#x2019;s deck, and <em>Kaga </em>erupted into an inferno from which it would never recover. </p><p>Arriving safely back at <em>Enterprise, </em>Dusty was met with heartbreaking news: his best friend was missing and presumed dead along with two dozen of their fellow naval aviators.

Digests of ten works like A Century of War, Tragedy and Hope, The Creature from Jekyll Island, and Dope Inc. yield an across-the-spectrum, composite profile of the suspect. Each covers a different aspect of the hydra-headed conspiracy that manipulates mankind in many different, even contradictory guises: it&#39;s the Anglo-American power elite, hiding in plain view. Knowledge is power. Unmasking the tricks of the &#34;wizard behind the curtain&#34; offers us the way to neutralize its power, and get our destiny back on the right track.</p><p>We present in this book overwhelming evidence that the many misfortunes our country has suffered during this last century have not just happened by chance. We have researched the works of many writers seeking to find out WHO is impoverishing us, and WHY and HOW they are doing it. Our findings are presented via a series of in-depth reviews of a carefully selected set of books, mostly little-known but a few famous, written by others. Taken together, a coherent picture emerges which precious few among even our political activists understand. We finish by laying out a legislative program which will finally get at our real problems, instead of wasting our efforts on the minutia which the media and the present Congress are concerning themselves with.More and more Americans are coming to feel that something has gone fundamentally wrong in our society. We have suffered repetitive wars, big and small, some won and some lost, but with the peace always lost. Our society has been drained of around $5 trillion in welfare costs since LBJ's War on Poverty was declared, but with no diminution in the incidence of "poverty." Our "War on Drugs" has also been lost, with its societal costs running around $500 billion per year. The cost of fixes for runaway environmentalism has reached about $1 trillion since the birth of the EPA in 1970. Our national debt is over $5 trillion and still going up. Two breadwinners per family has become normal, just to keep bread on the table. <p>Americans feel put upon, and they are right, but they don't know who's doing it to them or why. Such issues have been pondered by researchers for many years, but the historical facts are finally bringing the pieces of the puzzle together. This book paints a picture of that largely completed puzzle, and lays out who the culprits are, why they are doing what they are doing, and how they are managing to pull off what is probably the biggest mass robbery of wealth and individual freedom in human history. </p><p>Your reading this book will help to expose and stop the destruction, and help to guarantee a future of freedom rather than slavery for your children.</p></p><h2>Dictionary Of The Bible</h2><p><b>An excellent, single-volume Catholic dictionary of the Bible written by&nbsp;respected Catholic&nbsp;Biblical scholar John L.

And this political project, Todd McGowan contends, provides an avenue for emancipatory politics after the failure of Marxism in the twentieth century. </p><p>Where others seeking the political import of psychoanalysis have looked to Freud&#x2019;s early work on sexuality, McGowan focuses on Freud&#x2019;s discovery of the death drive and Jacques Lacan&#x2019;s elaboration of this concept. He argues that the self-destruction occurring as a result of the death drive is the foundational act of emancipation around which we should construct our political philosophy. Psychoanalysis offers the possibility for thinking about emancipation not as an act of overcoming loss but as the embrace of loss. It is only through the embrace of loss, McGowan suggests, that we find the path to enjoyment, and enjoyment is the determinative factor in all political struggles&#x2014;and only in a political project that embraces the centrality of loss will we find a viable alternative to global capitalism.</p></p><p>Todd McGowan is an associate professor of film studies at the University of Vermont. He is the author of several books, most recently <i>The Fictional Christopher Nolan</i> and <i>Out of Time: Desire in Atemporal Cinema</i>.&#34;Psychoanalysis does not provide new positive political programs; it just discerns the contours of a &#39;negativity, &#39; of a disruptive force--the death drive--which poses a threat to every stable collective link. Based on this insight, different psychoanalysts advocated views which were revolutionary, liberal, or conservative. But is this all that is to be said? McGowan&#39;s book introduces order into this mess by way of drawing a radically new line of separation: the true lesson of psychoanalysis is that emancipatory politics should not be based on any notion of the common Good, but on the negativity of the death drive itself. The consequences of this idea are shattering, taking us far beyond all the standard versions of Freudo-Marxism--nothing remains the same along the axis psychoanalysis-politics after &#34;Enjoying What We Don&#39;t Have&#34;.&#34; --Slavoj Zizek, author of &#34;Living in the End Times&#34;--Slavoj Zizek (03/25/2013)</p><h2>Mathematics and the Physical World (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>"Kline is a first-class teacher and an able writer. . . . This is an enlarging and a brilliant book." &#x2015; <i>Scientific American</i><br>"Dr. Morris Kline has succeeded brilliantly in explaining the nature of much that is basic in math, and how it is used in science." &#x2015; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>Since the major branches of mathematics grew and expanded in conjunction with science, the most effective way to appreciate and understand mathematics is in terms of the study of nature. Unfortunately, the relationship of mathematics to the study of nature is neglected in dry, technique-oriented textbooks, and it has remained for Professor Morris Kline to describe the simultaneous growth of mathematics and the physical sciences in this remarkable book. In a manner that reflects both erudition and enthusiasm, the author provides a stimulating account of the development of basic mathematics from arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, to calculus, differential equations, and the non-Euclidean geometries. At the same time, Dr. Kline shows how mathematics is used in optics, astronomy, motion under the law of gravitation, acoustics, electromagnetism, and other phenomena. Historical and biographical materials are also included, while mathematical notation has been kept to a minimum. <br>This is an excellent presentation of mathematical ideas from the time of the Greeks to the modern era.

When students become researchers, they become passionate about research and writing. My students saw research, writing, and critical analysis as relevant and even necessary activities. As a result, my classroom became a community of scholars immersed in examining the world around them, and I haven't looked back since. <strong>Candace Nadon, professor at Fort Lewis College </strong></p> <p>Teaching writing via communities and primary research truly enlivens and enriches the first-year classroom. <i>Primary Research and Writing: People, Places, and Spaces</i> is an incredibly useful text for exploring how to gather and write up firsthand data in the twenty-first century.

But had you been in my classroom that day, you'd have never known it. You'd have thought I believed that I was the one with all the answers."</em></p><p>Effective, intentional teaching begins with a strong set of beliefs, but even the best teachers -- including Debbie Miller -- struggle to make sure that their classroom practice consistently reflects their core convictions. In <em>Teaching with Intention</em>, Debbie shares her process of defining beliefs, aligning practice, and taking action to ensure that children are the true beneficiaries of her teaching. As Peter Johnston writes, "Through this book we have Debbie's teaching mind on loan. She engages us in the details of a teaching life from inside her mind, showing the thinking behind her teaching and the consequences of her actions."</p><p>While Debbie's previous book, <em>Reading with Meaning,</em> chronicled a year in her own classroom, <em>Teaching with Intention</em> brings us into classrooms of teachers and children she has met over the last five years in her work as a literacy consultant. From setting up the classroom environment to the intentional use of language, from comprehension instruction to lesson design, Debbie is explicit about what she does and why. At the same time, she encourages teachers to develop their own belief statements concerning teaching and learning, and includes key questions to guide them in this important process.</p><p>In an environment where the handing down of scripted programs and "foolproof" curricula is increasingly the norm, <em>Teaching with Intention</em> offers a compelling reminder that truly transformative teaching is built from the ground up, and is rebuilt every year, by every teacher, in every classroom, with every new group of students.</p></p><p><p>Debbie Miller taught and learned from children in The Denver Public Schools for thirty years. Author of&nbsp;<i>Reading with Meaning: Teaching Comprehension in the Primary Grades,&nbsp;2nd edition</i>&nbsp;(Stenhouse, 2012) and&nbsp;<i>Teaching with Intention: Defining Beliefs, Aligning Practice, Taking Action K-5</i>&nbsp;(Stenhouse, 2008), Debbie now presents workshops across the country and internationally, and works extensively with schools and districts on long-range planning and development of literacy programs.</p><p>She worked for many years with the Denver-based Public Education and Business Coalition (PEBC), a nonprofit group committed to providing ongoing support and leadership for schools in the Denver area and nationally. Debbie has also been an adjunct professor at The University of Denver and Regis University.</p>"<i>Teaching with Intentio</i>n is recommended for both teachers and teacher educators who want to work through the age-old theory-versus-practice struggle. Indeed, if Miller's story and classroom experiences are read and reflected on with the purpose of finding one's own solution to this ongoing dilemma, true teaching with intention might result." &nbsp;- <i>Education Review</i><br></p><h2>The Plays and Fragments (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The greatest writer of Greek New Comedy and the founding father of European comedy, Menander (c.341-290 BC) wrote over one hundred plays, of which only one complete play and substantial fragments of others survive.

Since 1907 papyri found in the sand of Egypt have brought to light more and more fragments and in 1958 the papyrus text of a complete play was published, The Bad-Tempered Man (Dyskolos).

While discussing connections with Plato and Kant, Adorno concentrates on the most systematic development of the dialectic in Hegel's philosophy, and its relationship to Marx, as well as elaborating his own conception of dialectical thinking as a critical response to this tradition.</p> <p>Delivered in the summer semester of 1958, these lectures allow Adorno to explore and probe the significant difficulties and challenges this way of thinking posed within the cultural and intellectual context of the post-war period. In this connection he develops the thesis of a complementary relationship between positivist or functionalist approaches, particularly in the social sciences, as well as calling for the renewal of ontological and metaphysical modes of thought which attempt to transcend the abstractness of modern social experience by appeal to regressive philosophical categories. While providing an account of many central themes of Hegelian thought, he also alludes to a whole range of other philosophical, literary and artistic figures of central importance to his conception of critical theory, notably Walter Benjamin and the idea of a constellation of concepts as the model for an 'open or fractured dialectic' beyond the constraints of method and system.</p> <p>These lectures are seasoned with lively anecdotes and personal recollections which allow the reader to glimpse what has been described as the 'workshop' of Adorno's thought. As such, they provide an ideal entry point for all students and scholars in the humanities and social sciences who are interested in Adorno's work as well as those seeking to understand the nature of dialectical thinking.</p></p><p><b>Theodor Adorno</b> (1903-1969), a prominent member of the Frankfurt School, was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century in the areas of social theory, philosophy and aesthetics."Despite Adorno&#x2019;s abiding suspicion of easy communicability, he was fully capable of explaining complex ideas lucidly and accessibly, never more so than in the lecture hall. There can be few concepts that demand as much careful exposition as 'dialectics,' whose multiple uses and frequent abuses have frustrated countless attempts to render it comprehensible. Still fewer exponents of dialectical thought have been as skilled in unpacking its meaning, while at the same time performatively demonstrating its virtues, as Adorno."<br><b> &#x2015;Martin Jay, University of California, Berkeley<br><br></b> "The twenty lectures that Adorno held in 1958 constitute the first comprehensive articulation of his thinking. The challenge to which he responds is that of wresting conceptual thinking from its narcissistic tendencies, as outlined in <i>Dialectics of Enlightenment</i>. 'Suffering and Happiness,' he insists, must be recognized as 'the immanent substance of dialectics'. Adorno&#x2019;s effort to turn thinking inside-out by revealing the affective origin of its transformative potential, remains his most enduring legacy."<br><b> &#x2015;Samuel Weber, Northwestern University<br></b><br>"one of the most lucid and accessible introductions to Hegel"<b><b><br><b>&#x2015;</b>Dublin Review of Books</b><br></b></p><h2>Pathophysiology of Nursing Demystified (Demystified Medical)</h2><p><p><b><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>The quick and easy way to learn the concepts of pathophysiology&#x2013; and how to apply them to real-world situations</b></p><p>If you're looking for a fun, fast review that boils pathophysiology down to its most essential, must-know points, your search ends here! <i>Pathophysiology of Nursing Demystified</i> is a complete yet concise overview of diseases and how they affect various body systems.

Clients question and often resist the complexities and uncertainties inherent in law and legal process. Honest advice from the lawyer can make a client doubt his or her allegiance and zeal. Client backlash may be directed at the lawyer who communicates bad news. Thus, the lawyer may feel torn between the obligation to clearly inform a client about weaknesses in legal positions and fear of damaging the client relationship. Too often, the lawyer struggles to counsel a particularly difficult client, but to no avail.<br><br><strong></strong><strong><em>Client Science</em></strong><strong></strong> is written to provide insight and advice to lawyers on how to more effectively communicate with their clients with regard to legal realities and difficult decisions. It will help lawyers with the always-difficult task of delivering "bad news," which will result in better-informed and thus more satisfied clients. The book explains applicable social science research and insights and translates them into plain language relevant to legal practice and client counseling. Marjorie Corman Aaron offers specific suggestions related to a lawyer's ordering, timing, phrasing, and type of explanation, as well as style adjustments for the lawyer's voice, gesture, and body position, all to impact client counseling and to improve the lawyer-client relationship.<br></p><p><br><strong>Marjorie Corman Aaron </strong>is Professor of Practice and Director, Center for Practice at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, where she teaches courses in negotiations, client counseling, mediation, and decision analysis. She is also an active mediator, arbitrator, and trainer in negotiation and dispute resolution in Cincinnati, Ohio, and previously served on the Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management, the Ethics Commission of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution, and the Publications Committee of the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution. Until July, 1998, Marjorie Aaron was the Executive Director of the Program on Negotiation ("PON") at Harvard Law School, where she was also a lecturer teaching negotiation. Prior to joining PON, Ms. Aaron was a Vice President at Endispute (now known as JAMS-ADR), and a panel mediator for the Middlesex Multi-Door Courthouse. She has designed and taught numerous workshops on mediation, negotiation, alternative dispute resolution, and litigation decision analysis for law firms, corporations and universities. She is the author of numerous articles, book chapters, cases, and guides in the field of negotiation, mediation and other forms of dispute resolution.<br><br>"No one wants to deliver bad news, but we all have to do it.

Her expert guidance and analysis will help lawyers handle tough client moments with grace, confidence, and control." <br>--Russ Bleemer, Editor, Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation <br><p></p><br>"In this highly readable book, Marjorie Corman Aaron focuses on the real world in which our clients make decisions. She presents a clear-eyed, holistic review of our clients' needs, perspectives, emotions, and false beliefs. Brimming with practical insights and supported by real-world examples, her advice will help counselors to assist clients in making wise decisions about risk -- which is, after all, what our clients want and need from their lawyers." <br>--Joseph D. Heyd, Director &amp; Associate General Counsel, Global Litigation <br>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company <br><p></p><br>"Lawyers need emotional intelligence as well as analytical abilities. Based on years of experience both as a classroom teacher and a mediator, Marjorie Corman Aaron's new book, Client Science is a 'must read' for lawyers who want to communicate more effectively with their clients and create more productive relationships." <br>--Robert H. Mnookin, Williston Professor of Law and Chair, Program on Negotiation, <br>Harvard Law School <br><p></p><br>"Marjorie Corman Aaron explores the characteristics that distinguish a great counselor from merely a good lawyer. Knowledge, strategy and skill all define a good lawyer, but it is emotional intelligence and the ability to communicate effectively that define a counselor who understands that client communication is not just about speaking; it is also about hearing and translating. Professor Aaron helps us understand how body position, posture, and motion all play a role in how clients listen, what they learn and how we are heard by them. Client Science should be mandatory reading for every lawyer entering the practice of law today." <br>--Regina M. Pisa, Esq., Chairman, Goodwin Procter LLP <br><p></p><br>"Client Science is a thoughtful and enlightened manual for perhaps the most difficult of all lawyering skills -- handling the client. Starting from a base of practical experience and social science, Marjorie Corman Aaron provides wise advice in an important area that is frequently neglected, if not ignored entirely. The book is not only clear and persuasive, it is one of those rare books that manages to be practical, entertaining, and thought-provoking at the same time. I strongly recommend it to lawyers and law students alike." <br>--F. Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge, District of Massachusetts <br><p></p><br>"Given the wide array of books addressing the many aspects of business and professional success, it is surprising how few texts there are offering practical advice for legal practitioners. Marjorie Corman Aaron's Client Science is a gem, providing common sense yet thought-provoking perspective on the challenges of counseling clients and practical advice for doing it effectively. The lessons are all the more powerful because they afford helpful insight and concrete approaches to lawyers at all stages of their career. This is a book I expect to go back to over and over again as long as I am practicing, and I strongly recommend it to law students, lawyers, faculty and professional development managers." <br>--Laura C. Hodges Taylor, Partner, Goodwin Procter LLP <br><p></p><br>"The bottom line is that effective communication skills are one of the keys to successfully representing your clients. Sure, skilled legal representation is important, but that's all for naught if, at the end of the day, your unhappy, confused, and frustrated clients end up seeking replacement counsel. So if nothing else, the lesson to be learned is that better communication results in better legal representation. This book will help you achieve both and is well worth the investment." <br>--Nicole Black, Rochester Daily Record <br><p></p><br>"Professor Aaron is a 'communication scholar.' She has researched the subject thoroughly and documented references in copious footnotes...This book would make a great...gift for new attorneys. It would be equally appreciated by experienced attorneys who aspire to be mediators. It is virtually a manual on communication. That it covers the topic so exhaustively makes sense because Professor Aaron is expert in both the psychology and the mechanics of communication." <br>--Kerri W. Feeney, <em>Trial News</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Capitalism: A Conversation in Critical Theory</h2><p>In this important new book, Nancy Fraser and Rahel Jaeggi take a fresh look at the big questions surrounding the peculiar social form known as &#x201c;capitalism,&#x201d; upending many of our commonly held assumptions about what capitalism is and how to subject it to critique. They show how, throughout its history, various regimes of capitalism have relied on a series of institutional separations between economy and polity, production and social reproduction, and human and non-human nature, periodically readjusting the boundaries between these domains in response to crises and upheavals. They consider how these &#x201c;boundary struggles&#x201d; offer a key to understanding capitalism&#x2019;s contradictions and the multiple forms of conflict to which it gives rise. <br><br>What emerges is a renewed crisis critique of capitalism which puts our present conjuncture into broader perspective, along with sharp diagnoses of the recent resurgence of right-wing populism and what would be required of a viable Left alternative. This major new book by two leading critical theorists will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the nature and future of capitalism and with the key questions of progressive politics today.<br></p><p><b>Nancy Fraser</b> is Henry A. &amp; Louise Loeb Professor of Political &amp; Social Science at the New School for Social Research<br><br><b>Rahel Jaeggi</b> is Professor of Practical Philosophy at the Humboldt University of Berlin&#x201c;As the world is caught up in a whirlwind of multiple crises - social, ecological, political, civilizational - we desperately need to get our hands on and shut down the source.

Fraser in particular elaborates on her path-breaking &#x2018;unifying&#x2019; theory of capitalism as a system resting on several hidden abodes that&nbsp;it cannot live without and cannot avoid wrecking.

In the first book, <i>Red Dragon</i> (filmed as <i>Manhunter</i>), Hannibal diabolically helps the FBI track a fascinating serial killer. (Takes one to know one.) In <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.<p> Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>.</p><p> Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</p><p> What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>'s Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste. Harris's secret recipe for success is restraint. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal. Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody.

She lives in Laguna Beach, California.one <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Daire <br>I wake to a room gone suddenly bright as Axel calls to me from his place by the door. <br>He pauses. Allowing time for me to gather myself, begin the slow crawl from slumber, before he makes his way to my bedside. His approach heralded by the soft hum of his breath rising and falling&#x2014;the muffled hush of his feet crossing the smooth limestone floor. <br>His voice is a melody. <br>His movements an inspired choreography. <br>Still, when he stands by my side and places a tentative hand on my shoulder, I shrink from his touch and squinch my eyes shut. Stretching back to the dream where I cling to the memory of Dace&#x2019;s embrace. The sweep of his fingers moving over my flesh&nbsp;&#x2026; the press of his lips meeting mine&nbsp;&#x2026; desperate to lose myself in the glittering burn of his kaleidoscope eyes, reflecting my image thousands of times. Preferring the fantasy of Dace and me blissfully reunited at the Enchanted Spring, to the barren truth that awaits me. <br>&#x201c;Daire, please. I know you&#x2019;re awake.&#x201d; Axel keeps his tone light, as though he&#x2019;s not the least bit annoyed by the game. &#x201c;I will gladly sit here all day if that&#x2019;s what it takes.&#x201d; He claims a space on my mattress and waits for me to acknowledge him. <br>&#x201c;You have the patience of a saint,&#x201d; I snap, reluctantly forfeiting the dream and accepting it for the ghost that it is. My eyes widening at the sight of Axel&#x2019;s anxious lavender gaze. Caught by the way it darkens to a deep stormy amethyst, before turning as clear and luminous as the day we first met. <br>The day our first words were spoken, formalities exchanged. <br>The day he swept me into his arms and rocketed me high into the sky. Piercing through the glorious silken spun web that yielded to a world of bright golden light. <br>So unlike the prior times&#x2014;once deep underwater&#x2014;once in a haunted Moroccan square&#x2014;back when I was na�ve enough to disregard the events as coincidence. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hardly a saint.&#x201d; His fingers spear through his shock of blond hair that swoops over his brow and falls in loose curls past his cheek. A move I&#x2019;ve observed countless times, and yet, it&#x2019;s no less enchanting than the first. The platinum strands seamlessly blending into a complexion so fair, smooth, and translucent, I can&#x2019;t help but think (and not for the first time) that between the pastel eyes and porcelain skin, he appears so exquisite, so strikingly angelic, the only things missing are a halo and wings. <br>&#x201c;If not a saint, then an angel, perhaps?&#x201d; The question hangs heavy between us, not nearly as jokey as it might seem on the surface. Here in the Upperworld, anything is possible, and I&#x2019;m eager to get to the truth of this strange situation I find myself in. &#x201c;Or a spirit guide, maybe? Perhaps even <i>my</i> spirit guide?&#x201d; <br>My gaze narrows on his as I silently ponder the unspoken questions: <br> <i>Am I a convalescent or a captive?</i> <br> <i>Is he saving me or enslaving me?</i> <br>Assured by the way he flinches, the way he tears his gaze away, that he heard the thoughts as well as the words. <br>&#x201c;What if I told you I was none of those things?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;d suspect you were lying,&#x201d; I say in a voice that&#x2019;s strong and sure. Wanting him to know that while I may be at a physical disadvantage, dependent on his willingness to take care of me and tend to my wounds, my will is still strong. My days as an invalid are nearing an end. <br>He lowers his chin, sending a tumble of blond curls sailing over his forehead, down past the finely sculpted bridge of his nose, before landing at the perfect bow of his lips. &#x201c;If you insist on a label, and clearly you do, then I guess you could say I&#x2019;m a Mystic.&#x201d; He runs his palms down the crisp white tunic he wears. <br>&#x201c;A Mystic?&#x201d; My tone is as stark as my face. <br>He nods, making great study of the abstract, Georgia O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2013;style painting of a vibrant blue lake on the far side of the room, before settling on the small, glass-tiled pool where I often bathe in a modest white gown as Axel rinses the suds from my shoulders and hair. <br>&#x201c;Define Mystic,&#x201d; I say. Despite a number of prior attempts, this is the most I&#x2019;ve ever gotten out of him, and I plan to push it as far as I can. <br>&#x201c;One who is initiated into esoteric mysteries.&#x201d; He turns to me, clearly pleased with his explanation, but I&#x2019;m far from satisfied. <br>&#x201c;Would you care to elaborate, or are you being purposely vague?&#x201d; I lift my chin, quirk a brow, surprised to find my sarcasm tested by the shock of his luminous grin. A grin that begins at the tip of his chin and creeps all the way to the haphazard part in his hair. A grin so open, kind, and authentic, it takes all of my will to curb the impulse to return it. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being purposely vague, there&#x2019;s no use denying it. So now, if the interrogation is over, perhaps we can talk about you?&#x201d; Misreading my silence for surrender, he leans closer. &#x201c;How are you feeling?&#x201d; he asks, studying me with a concerned eye and a cool palm that travels from my brow to my cheek. Searching for signs of the fever and chills that have plagued me since I arrived in this place. <br>&#x201c;The interrogation is <i>never</i> over. You should know that by now.&#x201d; I pull away from his touch, striving for a stern voice and the expression to match. Resolved to get at least a few of the answers I seek. &#x201c;What exactly is a Mystic?&#x201d; I demand. <br>He shutters his eyes, sighing when he says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s of a scope that is far beyond human comprehension.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Try me.&#x201d; I frown. Glare. Commit to waiting for however long it takes to get him to properly answer me. But all I get in return is a view of Axel&#x2019;s grin. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Axel,&#x201d; I plead. &#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t you tell me what it means? Is everyone in the Upperworld a Mystic? And if so, where are they? Why haven&#x2019;t I seen anyone but you the whole time I&#x2019;ve been here?&#x201d; <br>He commits to the silence, leaving the questions to hang heavy between us. <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I breathe a frustrated sigh. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t think this is over. You can evade me for now, but I&#x2019;ll find out eventually. You&#x2019;re not the only stubborn one around here.&#x201d; I do my best to rebuff the lure of his charm, but it&#x2019;s no use. Even when he&#x2019;s not smiling, chucking a self-conscious hand through his hair, or engaging in any of his other well-practiced gestures from the &#x201c;Handbook of Disarming Moves,&#x201d; he radiates such an abundance of genuine kindness, benevolence, and undeniable charisma, it&#x2019;s not long before I fold. &#x201c;So, in the spirit of cooperation&#x2014;which, by the way, is something you could stand to learn a thing or two about&#x2014;I will answer your question by saying my fever has finally broke.&#x201d; <br>I watch as his fingers move from his lap to my cheek and then back to his lap. Captured by the way his movements cast the most glorious veil of light, bearing no hint of darkness or shadow. <br>&#x201c;And my memory is returning,&#x201d; I add, noting the fleeting flicker of worry that crosses his face as his gaze returns to the painting. <br>&#x201c;And exactly what do these memories reveal?&#x201d; he asks, his voice as quiet and uncertain as I&#x2019;ve ever heard. <br>I hesitate, needing a moment to decide what to say. Torn between the desire to pretend to know more than I do&#x2014;if for no other reason than to gain some semblance of an upper hand&#x2014;and admitting I know very little in the hope that he&#x2019;ll finally explain how he came to find me dying in the Lowerworld with my own athame turned against me. The double-edged blade bisecting my heart as Cade Richter moved to stake claim on my soul. <br>&#x201c;I know there was a struggle. I know that I lost. And I was hoping you could fill in the blanks.&#x201d; I stare hard at his profile, willing him to turn to me, acknowledge me, but for the longest time, he favors the wall. &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Keep your secrets for now. It&#x2019;s not like I won&#x2019;t find out eventually. But, if nothing else, can you please just tell me whether or not Dace is okay? I&#x2019;m thinking that if I&#x2019;m here in the Upperworld with you, then everyone in the Middleworld probably assumes that I&#x2019;m dead. Which means that the prophecy was averted. Which also means that Dace is alive&#x2014;that I was able to save him. <i>Right?</i>&#x201d; <br>Axel clamps his lips so tightly it takes all of my will to keep from grabbing hold of his shoulders and shaking him until he responds. Allowing an annoyingly long drag of time to loll before he says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not keeping secrets, Daire. It&#x2019;s just I see no point in reliving the past when the present awaits.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the past that got me here!&#x201d; I cry, instantly regretting the hysterical ring to my words. I&#x2019;m getting worked up. I need to rein it in. Need to rebuild my strength. These emotional outbursts never result in anything good. &#x201c;How long have I been here?&#x201d; I ask, casually broaching the question as though I&#x2019;m only mildly curious. My attempts at keeping track have left me confused. Most of my time is spent sleeping, and the light seeping through the curtain-covered window never seems to change all that much, making it impossible to count the succession of days. <br>&#x201c;Linear time does not exist here.&#x201d; Axel shrugs. &#x201c;But then you already knew that.&#x201d; He brings a hand close to my chest, ready to move on to more pressing concerns. &#x201c;May I?&#x201d; His hand hovers uncertainly, awaiting permission to proceed, despite the fact that as my only caretaker this is hardly the first time he&#x2019;s done this. <br>I nestle my cheek against the pile of downy pillows with soft silken cases he&#x2019;s placed under my head. Embarrassed by the rush of blood that creeps up my neck and floods my cheeks as he loosens my robe until my wound is exposed. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s healing nicely.&#x201d; He skims a finger along the jagged, puckered line of angry red flesh he coaxed back together with his platinum needle and spool of golden thread. His touch reverberating straight through my core, all the way to the invisible network of scars hidden under the surface, where he worked his magick and reassembled my heart. <br>&#x201c;How soon can I return?&#x201d; I ask. It&#x2019;s the same question I always ask. <br>And like always, Axel defers. Grabbing a small glass jar from the nightstand, he repeats his usual mantra of &#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; as he removes the lid and places it on the glass-topped table beside me. &#x201c;But soon&nbsp;&#x2026; very soon&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>He dips a finger into the fragrant blue ointment, about to apply it to the wound, when I catch him at the wrist and push his hand away. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want it to fade,&#x201d; I say, rendered nearly breathless from the effort it takes to resist him. Fielding his skeptical look, I add, &#x201c;Now that I remember, I can&#x2019;t afford to forget what landed me here.&#x201d; <br>He mutters under his breath. Some archaic language with slurred vowels and hard consonants I don&#x2019;t understand. Then he abandons the jar, pulls my robe closed, and with a sigh of resignation, says, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re entertaining thoughts of revenge, I&#x2019;d advise you to quit. You&#x2019;ll only lower yourself to Cade&#x2019;s level, squelch your potential, and establish yourself as his equal. Is that what you want?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not revenge that motivates me.&#x201d; I clench my hands into fists, my actions betraying my words. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s love. Dace is my only concern.&#x201d; At the mention of his name, my heart clenches in pain. Imagining the grief he must be feeling, not knowing the full truth of what really happened that night. <br>And while the exact events may continue to elude me as well, one thing is sure: I saved him. <br>I died so that Dace could live. <br>Except that I&#x2019;m not really dead. <br>He just thinks that I am. <br>&#x201c;Best not to think about that either.&#x201d; Axel turns his back in dismissal. &#x201c;You need to get well. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d; He scoops an uncertain hand through his hair. <br>&#x201c;Is that the <i>only</i> reason I&#x2019;m here?&#x201d; I prop myself higher onto my pillows, and stare hard at his back. It&#x2019;s an uncomfortable subject, but I need to know once and for all. <br> <i>Why did he save me?</i> <br> <i>And what does he expect in return?</i> <br>&#x201c;What are you really asking me, Daire?&#x201d; He faces me with a gaze so open, so direct, I&#x2019;m instantly silenced. No longer sure how to phrase what I most want to say. <br> <i>Is he a crazy stalker who took advantage of a moment of weakness in order to abduct me?</i> <br> <i>Or is he truly a Good Samaritan, a Mystic, as he claims, with only my best interests at heart?</i> <br>While he&#x2019;s always treated me with kindness and respect, I can&#x2019;t help but suspect that his motives aren&#x2019;t entirely altruistic. <br>We fall into an uncomfortable, sagging silence. The kind that used to spur me to say something stupid, crack a dumb joke, but no more. I&#x2019;m no longer that girl. The new Daire is patient. <br>She&#x2019;s willing to wait. <br>She has no other choice. <br>But when Axel makes for the door, I instantly regret having pushed it too far. He can&#x2019;t leave. Not yet. He&#x2019;s not the only one with an agenda here. <br>I lift myself until I&#x2019;m almost fully upright, making an exaggerated show of breathing heavily and gritting my teeth. And just as I&#x2019;d hoped, an instant later he&#x2019;s right back beside me. <br> <i>Patience</i>. <i>You can do this</i>. <i>It&#x2019;s like Paloma taught you: Think from the end.</i> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t push it, Daire.&#x201d; Axel&#x2019;s fingers grab hold of my shoulders as he lowers me back toward my pillows. &#x201c;Just because the fever broke doesn&#x2019;t mean that you&#x2019;re healed.&#x201d; <br>I nod as though I wouldn&#x2019;t dream of questioning his wisdom, the irrefutable truth of his words. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m just feeling a little restless,&#x201d; I say, aiming for chagrin and hoping I&#x2019;m not overdoing it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not used to being bedridden and weak, and that makes me a pretty poor patient.&#x201d; I make a guilty face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that, if I&#x2019;ve any hope of leaving this place, I&#x2019;ll need to work on regaining my strength. The longer I lie here, the more my muscles will deteriorate. So, maybe I could try to walk for a bit. What do you think?&#x201d; <br>I hold my breath and shoot him my most hopeful look, aiming to convince without coming off as rehearsed. <br>When he doesn&#x2019;t reply fast enough for my liking, I struggle to sit up again. Grimacing and gritting until I&#x2019;m propped flushed and breathless against the headboard, begging, &#x201c;Please. I need to get up and move around&#x2014;take a short walk. But I need your help. I can&#x2019;t do it alone.&#x201d; I force myself to swallow the lie, but the bitterness sticks to my tongue. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Axel, didn&#x2019;t you promise to heal me, rehabilitate me? Isn&#x2019;t that what you said?&#x201d; <br>His brow knits, his lips pull into a frown, and I know that I&#x2019;ve won. That he sees what I want him to see&#x2014;me, clammy, breathless, and pale&#x2014;making demands that betray my abilities. <br>I suck in a lungful of air, curl my fingers around the side of the mattress, and attempt to swing my legs over the edge. The sight of it causing him to say, &#x201c;Clearly nothing I say will change your mind.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Clearly,&#x201d; I whisper, indulging a small, secret smile when he secures an arm around my waist and eases me to my feet until my body is wedged hard against his. <br>His touch providing a reassuring strength that leaves me uneasy, reminding me of the moment he saved me. The way his lips pressed hard against mine as he snatched me from the fingers of death&#x2014;restoring my life with a kiss. <br> <i>The question is why?</i> <br> <i>Why me?</i> <br> <i>And, more importantly, now that he&#x2019;s saved me, why is he hiding me?</i> <br>Not a single person has dropped by the whole time I&#x2019;ve been here. And often, when he thinks I&#x2019;m asleep, I watch through slitted lids as he peers through the curtains, fingers twitching nervously at the thought of being seen. <br>While there&#x2019;s no denying the amount of care and devotion he&#x2019;s paid me, his reluctance to answer my questions leads me to believe his motives aren&#x2019;t nearly as pure as they seem. That they have less to do with his inner moral compass, and more to do with the simple fact that, for whatever reason, he couldn&#x2019;t bear to lose me. <br>Like he has a personal stake in my being....</p><h2>Tai Chi Fa Jin: Advanced Techniques for Discharging Chi Energy</h2><p>A guide to the seemingly effortless yet explosively powerful martial art techniques of Fa Jin <br> <br>� Explains how to collect energy within and discharge it for self-defense as well as healing <br> <br>� Explores how to counter the natural instinct to resist force with force and develop yielding softness through the 13 Original Movements of Tai Chi <br> <br>� Illustrates routines for the partner practice of &#x201c;Push Hands&#x201d; (Tui Shou) <br> <br>Fa Jin, an advanced yang style of Tai Chi, complements the physical, mental, and spiritual conditioning available through solo Tai Chi practice and the internal martial arts of Taoism.

In so doing they offer a new understanding of human development that points a way to change in all of our institutions-work, community, school, and family-and is sure to transform lives.</p><p>Jean Baker Miller, M.D., is clinical professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine and founding director of the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute, a division of the Stone Center at Wellesley College.<br><br>Irene Pierce Stiver, Ph.D., is director emerita of the psychology department at McLean Hospital, lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and a founding scholar of the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute.A succinct account of why some women have difficulties entering into ``growth-fostering'' relationships and how, with the help of therapy, they can grow in this regard. Miller (Toward a New Psychology of Women, 1976), one of the leading theorists of feminist psychology, and Stiver, former director of McLean Hospital's psychology department, bring a clear feminist perspective to their research, demonstrating how, for example, the experience of power inequities at work or in relationships can make women act in inhibited or ingratiating ways. Yet the authors' work has almost as much relevance for men, particularly in their probing and sensitive exploration of what they call ``strategies of disconnection,'' such as a disinclination to enter into intimate relationships or to emotionally engage a therapist. Miller and Stiver point to three major childhood sources of such emotional distancing: deep family secrets that children intuit and that sometimes haunt them; parental emotional inaccessibility; and family circumstances that ``parentify'' a child, that is, force the child to assume certain adult responsibilities in the home. Rather than viewing lack of therapeutic engagement as resistance, as traditional interpretations would have it, Baker and Stiver view such ``disconnection'' as a necessary strategy to protect a traumatized or otherwise vulnerable sense of self. The authors sometimes lapse into psychobabble, particularly in overusing the word ``empowering,'' one of the limper adjectives of contemporary popular psychology. But more often, their helpful book, which will be of interest to both clinicians and their clients, is written in clear-headed prose and features a significant number of useful case studies. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She grew up in Great Britain and now lives in San Rafael, CA.*Starred Review* Bowen, the Agatha winner responsible for the popular Molly Murphy series, has come up with another winner in her new heroine, Lady Georgina, the least important member of the royal family. Thirty-fourth in the line of succession, Georgie may have the title but none of the money. What's a girl to do? Well, in Georgie's case, she tries opening her own domestic agency, with herself as the only domestic. Even her brother, Binky, the duke, is barely holding on to the family castle in Scotland, and that hold becomes tenuous when a French rogue claims to have proof that Binky and Georgie's father gambled the homestead away before his suicide. So, when the Frenchie winds up drowned in the bathroom of Binky's Belgrave house, there's reason to worry. After Binky's arrest, Georgie feels it's up to her to find the real murderer, but soon she finds her own life threatened, repeatedly. The mystery jigs and jags, but the best part here is Bowen's evocation of 1930s England. Drawing on Georgie's diary entries, she vividly portrays what daily life between the wars was like for a modern young woman bumping up against tradition. Populated with lots of neatly delineated characters, including Mrs. Simpson and a sexy Irish lord attempting to help Georgie lose her burdensome virginity, this is a smashing romp. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

There was noth�ing in his background to prepare him for the stage. His father knew everything about the violin and was familiar with every aspect of church music, but opera was foreign territory to him. It is true that during their three visits to Italy, they had the opportunity to see op�era, and Mozart (not his father) successfully absorbed various forms of Italian musical idiom. But until he began to grow up, Mozart rarely went to the theater, especially the opera. He seems to have ac�quired the instinct to make music dramatic, to animate people on stage, entirely from his own personality.</p><p>Yet his impact on the form was fundamental. He found opera, so called, in rudimentary shape and transformed it into a great, many-faceted art. He is the first composer of operas who has never been out of the repertoire, but is an indispensable part of it, a central fact in the history of opera. He forms, along with Verdi and Wagner, the great tripod on which the genus of opera rests, but whereas they de�voted their lives to the business, opera is for Mozart only one part of his musical career; not necessarily the most important part, either.</p><p>Mozart composed twenty operas, by one computation, twenty-two by another. Opera was evolving fast in the eighteenth century, and definition is difficult. To begin with, it was composed in four main languages, Italian, French, German, and English. Opera seria, or tragic opera, was the first main type to emerge with its particular forms: arias, choruses, and recitative. An intermezzo developed to provide comic relief, or buffa. This expanded until it became a work in its own right, an opera buffa, or comic opera. There was a good deal of class consciousness in these musical forms. Opera Seria took tragic themes from antiquity on Latin or Greek models and was per�formed at court on solemn occasions, usually in the top court the�ater. Hence it was also called grand opera. Opera buffa could be done in a commercial theater to a bourgeois audience. But in England and northern Germany (and elsewhere), a popular or plebeian opera, or rather plays punctuated by songs and performed in the vernacular, was also blossoming and proved irresistible. The Beggar&#x2019;s Opera ran in London for years and was taken to Germany, and there blended with local versions to produce a form of music drama called singspiel. By the time Mozart reached maturity, there were thus three main types of musical drama on stage: opera seria and opera buffa, both in Ital�ian, and singspiel in German.</p><p>But Mozart&#x2019;s evolution as a stage composer was more compli�cated. His first effort, given May 13, 1767, when he was eleven, was Apollo et Hyacinthus. This was, strictly speaking, an intermezzo, in�serted in the interval of Rufinus Widl&#x2019;s Latin play Clementia Croesi, given to an academic audience in the auditorium of Salzburg&#x2019;s Bene�dictine University. It was also in Latin but sung by two sopranos, two contraltos, a tenor, and bass, and scored for strings, two oboes, and two horns. He enjoyed this enormously, and so, it seems, did the audience. So in 1768&#x2013;69 he tried his hand both at an opera buffa, La finta semplice, and a singspiel. The first was ultimately derived from a Carlo Goldoni comedy, the second from a tale by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. There followed in 1770 his first opera seria, Mitridate, re di Ponto, written for four sopranos, an alto, and two tenors, and scored for strings, two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, and four horns (K. 87).</p><p>Mozart was gaining experience, and not all his efforts for the stage were operas. In 1771 he wrote a festa teatrale for the wedding of Archduke Ferdinand with a Modena princess. This was called As�canio in Alba and had a large number of singers. The orchestra was big and included a serpent, the only time Mozart used one (K. 111). His dull celebration of Colloredo&#x2019;s installation was described as a ser�enata, and K. 208, Il re pastore as a dramma per musica. But there was a regular opera buffa of a sort, La finta giardinera (K. 196), written in 1774, and Lucio Silla (K. 135), an opera seria, from 1772; Semiramis, described as a duodrama, is lost and may never have been started. Thamos, K�nig in �gypten was &#x201c;a play with music&#x201d; (K. 345), but again had a large orchestra. Zaide (K. 344) is a singspiel but is incomplete. Mozart wrote fifteen numbers to be sung, and had only the final scene to write (plus the overture) when he dropped it&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t know why. There is no libretto, so no spoken dialogue has survived, though various modern attempts have been made to stage it.</p><p>These operas, if finished, were put on in various places&#x2014;private houses, the archbishop&#x2019;s palace, the ducal theater in Milan, and the Assembly Rooms in Munich. Not one has a decent libretto. Almost all contain fine music. Much of the action on stage is highly improb�able, and some of it makes little sense. The Italian operatic tradition, which pervades them, took little account of probabilities. Mozart had an instinct for realism, an urge to make music and drama corre�spond, to some extent at least, to ordinary life as he and his contem�poraries knew it, but he was too young and inexperienced as yet to break through the conventions and take charge.</p><p>The change came with Idomeneo (K. 366), which Mozart was commissioned to write in 1780 when he was twenty-four and which was presented in Munich on January 29, 1781. This was to some ex�tent the product of the Mannheim revolution in music inspired by Elector Carl Frederick, whose court oscillated between Mann�heim and Munich and whose orchestra&#x2014;which Mozart&#x2019;s father said was the best he had ever heard&#x2014;traveled with the court. It had clarinets, to Mozart&#x2019;s delight, and a whole range of expert instrumentalists. The elector, who played the flute and the cello himself, was always encouraging and aimed at the highest standards, and among the Mannheim crowd, as he called them, Mozart felt all his powers put to the test.</p><p>What matters about Idomeneo is not the libretto, which despite all Mozart&#x2019;s changes and improvements remains a ragged and im�plausible affair, but the music. Opera at the beginning of the last quarter of the eighteenth century&#x2014;even opera seria&#x2014;was a scrappy business. There were literally scores of composers, countless librettists or would-be librettists&#x2014;Mozart told his father he had read through &#x201c;over a hundred&#x201d; looking for something suitable&#x2014;and endless opera houses or halls used as such, the length and breadth of Italy. Operas were put together from different texts and scores, arias inserted at a whim or at the request of a particular singer, scratch orchestras hired at the last minute, and cuts and additions made without reference to the composer or author. An opera performance was as much a social as a musical event, more so in most cases. Mozart became aware in Mannheim what an opera could be, and he began to write Idomeneo accordingly. As he wrote, his perfectionist daemon took over, and he lost consciousness of the dusty, threadbare, lackadaisical opera per�formances he was used to and found himself inhabiting a perfect world of brilliantly accomplished singers and instrumentalists, fine stage sets and acoustics, all well rehearsed with a thorough knowl�edge of the music and with himself in charge, possessing absolute power over the whole.</p><p>This is the only explanation for the quality of the score, which is a whole category above anything he had written previously for the stage, an adventure into new territory. It has ten characteristics we associate with mature Mozart opera. First, emotional intensity. This is so marked, almost from the first bars, that in another composer one would be tempted to declare that he must have been exposed to a haunting or overwhelming experience&#x2014;love, bereavement, tragedy, a violent or searching change in his entire lifestyle&#x2014;to produce such a searching effect on his output. But that is not, I think, the way he worked. Events in his life did not transform his music. What did so were events in his imagination. He had the gift of taking a dismal or routine story and a poverty-stricken libretto and allowing his imagi�nation to fill them with emotional dynamite that produced the most glorious music.</p><p>The emotional intensity of the music is high throughout but reaches periodic climaxes. This is achieved by the next three charac�teristics, three particular musical devices: the use of the woodwinds to follow and emphasize the voice in recitative, an innovation of Mo�zart&#x2019;s; the use of trombones at particular points, notably when the oracle speaks; and the use of brass mutes during the march in Act Two. The fifth characteristic is the careful, rich, and discriminate scoring of flutes, oboes, bassoons, and trumpets. Sixth is the way dif�ferent sections of the orchestra talk to each other, especially tremolos in the strings responding to the muted trumpets. Perhaps Mozart&#x2019;s greatest single gift as an orchestral musician was the way in which he made different instruments respond to, mingle, and contrast with one another, and here in Idomeneo it comes into full play with the added dimension of the singer or singers or chorus on stage.</p><p>Seventh is the use of key changes to advance the musical action. The harmonies move all the time, and even in the recitatives, there are constant harmonic progressions and retreats, and the tonalities cover a great deal of ground. Eighth is the way in which Mozart pro�duces a seamless garment, moving swiftly from one passage to an�other, scarcely leaving time or a natural interval for applause. Ninth is the deliberate arrangement of tonalities from the beginning to the end of an act, which produces a sense of continuity and unity. Fi�nally, he binds all together by introducing motifs that the listener/spectator gets to know and recognize and welcome. What Mozart is doing is giving the opera its own kind of sonata form and so the sense of organic growth. All these changes and improvements, taken to�gether, give the sense that writing an opera is being taken out of the hands of amateurs and put into the safe custody of a professional who knows exactly what he is doing.</p><p>None of this, of course, was a formula for success in Mozart&#x2019;s life�time. There were three performances of the initial production of Idomeneo, and a concert production by amateurs in the palace of a prince in Vienna. Mozart considered a proposal to revive it &#x201c;in the French style,&#x201d; with a German text and various changes in the singing roles, but nothing came of it. The next production was not until 1806, a quarter century after Mozart&#x2019;s death. It has never been exactly pop�ular, an opera to be revived rather than a standard in the repertory, but it has a substantial place in musical history.</p><p>By contrast, Die Entf�hrung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), a singspiel produced eighteen months later in the Vi�enna Burgtheater, July 16, 1782, was not a revolution in opera making but proved a distinct success with the public. Emperor Joseph II had created the Burgtheater as a German national theater but had been disappointed by the response of German playwrights and had had to be content with adaptations from the French. He was de�lighted, thus, to have Mozart, whom he admired, working for him on a libretto by Johann Gottlieb Stephanie the Younger. This tale of goings-on in a Turkish harem was dramatic, topical (the Turks were still threatening Vienna), and lent itself to East-West culture con�trasts in musical idiom, so Mozart fell on it with enthusiasm and composed three arias on the first day of work. A letter to his father gives an insight into his musical-dramatic mind at work. The villain&#x2019;s part of Osmin, he wrote, was intended for the bass, Fischer, who certainly has an excellent bass voice. . . [and] has the whole Viennese public on his side. . . . so he has been given an aria in Act I, and he is to have another in Act II. I have explained to Stephanie the words I require for the aria&#x2014;indeed I had finished composing most of the music for it before Stephanie knew any�thing whatever about it. I am enclosing only the beginning and the end, which is bound to have a good effect. Osmin&#x2019;s rage is rendered comical by the use of the Turkish music. In working out the aria I have (in spite of our Salzburg Midas) allowed Fisch�er&#x2019;s beautiful deep notes to glow. The passage &#x2018;Drum beim Barte des Propheten&#x2019; is indeed in the same tempo, but with quick notes; and as Osmin&#x2019;s rage gradually increases, there comes (just when the aria seems to be at an end) the allegro assai, which is in a totally different metre and in a different key; this is bound to be very effective. For just as a man in such a towering rage over�steps all the bounds of order, moderation and propriety and completely forgets himself, so must the music too forget itself. But since passions, whether violent or not, must never be ex�pressed to the point of exciting disgust, and as music, even in the most terrible situations, must never offend the ear, but must please the listener, or in other words must never cease to be mu�sic, so I have not chosen a key foreign to F (in which the aria is written) but one related to it&#x2014;not the nearest, D minor, but the more remote A minor.</p><p>This letter of September 26, 1781, goes on to explain how he ex�presses Belmonte&#x2019;s &#x201c;throbbing heart&#x201d; by &#x201c;the two violins playing oc�taves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wrote it expressly to suit Adamberger&#x2019;s voice. You see the trembling&#x2014;the faltering&#x2014;you see how his throbbing breast begins to swell; this I have expressed by a crescendo. You hear the whimper�ing and the sighing&#x2014;which I have indicated by the first violins with mutes and a flute playing in unison.&#x201d;</p><p>This letter and others are priceless glimpses into the composition of a work of art and are quite unique in musical history. They remind us that not the least of the valuable habits Leopold Mozart instilled into his son was the regular writing of detailed letters about his ac�tivities.</p><p>The opera was well rehearsed and got its first performance on July 16, 1782, to general applause. An attempt to hiss it down by the claque paid to support opera in Italian only was a failure. The emperor at�tended and gave his approval but added, &#x201c;It is too beautiful for hu�man ears, my dear Mozart, and has an unconscionable number of notes.&#x201d; &#x201c;Too many notes&#x201d; was a charge often brought against Mozart in his day&#x2014;and after&#x2014;though never by true musicians. What it usu�ally means is that the music, especially the orchestration, is complex, difficult, and rich; in the sense that a huge amount of thought has gone into its harmonies and each instrument has a role to play each in unison. Mozart&#x2019;s knowledge was so deep and his instinct for qual�ity so powerful that he could compose in this way almost without a positive intellectual effort. A combination of sounds that it would take a lesser man hours to produce (and then might not work) was for him a matter of minutes: The labor lay in getting the notes on the page. This was particularly...</p></p><h2>How to Overcome Worry: Experiencing the Peace of God in Every Situation</h2><p><p><b>Scripture&#x2019;s cure for the worry epidemic </b></p><p>Do you struggle with worry or anxious thoughts on a regular basis?

Pity we weren&#x2019;t.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> It is Sunday morning. They sit in the kitchen, drinking their coffee, slowly, remembering the past. They say the names of people as if they were magic. Peter thinks, Agnes Brusen, but there are hundreds of other names. As a private married joke, Peter and Sheilah wear the silk dressing gowns they bought in Hong Kong. Each thinks the other a peacock, rather splendid, but they pretend the dressing gowns are silly and worn in fun. <br> &nbsp;<br> Peter and Sheilah and their two daughters, Sandra and Jennifer, are visiting Peter&#x2019;s unmarried sister, Lucille. They have been Lucille&#x2019;s guests seventeen weeks, ever since they returned to Toronto from the Far East. Their big old steamer trunk blocks a corner of the kitchen, making a problem of the refrigerator door; but even Lucille says the trunk may as well stay where it is, for the present. The Fraziers&#x2019; future is so unsettled; everything is still in the air.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucille has given her bedroom to her two nieces, and sleeps on a camp cot in the hall. The parents have the living-room divan. They have no privileges here; they sleep after Lucille has seen the last television show that interests her. In the hall closet their clothes are crushed by winter overcoats. They know they are being judged for the first time. Sandra and Jennifer are waiting for Sheilah and Peter to decide. They are waiting to learn where these exotic parents will fly to next. What sort of climate will Sheilah consider? What job will Peter consent to accept? When the parents are ready, the children will make a decision of their own. It is just possible that Sandra and Jennifer will choose to stay with their aunt.<br> &nbsp;<br> The peacock parents are watched by wrens. Lucille and her nieces are much the same &#x2013; sandy-colored, proudly plain. Neither of the girls has the father&#x2019;s insouciance or the mother&#x2019;s appearance &#x2013; her height, her carriage, her thick hair and sky-blue eyes. The children are more cautious than their parents; more Canadian. When they saw their aunt&#x2019;s apartment they had been away from Canada nine years, ever since they were two and four; and Jennifer, the elder, said, &#x2018;&#x2018;Well, now we&#x2019;re home.&#x2019;&#x2019; Her voice is nasal and flat. Where did she learn that voice? And why should this be home? Peter&#x2019;s answer to anything about his mystifying children is, &#x2018;&#x2018;It must be in the blood.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> On Sunday morning Lucille takes her nieces to church. It seems to be the only condition she imposes on her relations: The children must be decent. The girls go willingly, with their new hats and purses and gloves and coral bracelets and strings of pearls. The parents, ramshackle, sleepy, dim in the brain because it is Sunday, sit down to their coffee and privacy and talk of the past.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;We weren&#x2019;t crooked,&#x2019;&#x2019; says Peter. &#x2018;&#x2018;We weren&#x2019;t even smart.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sheilah&#x2019;s head bobs up; she is no drowner. It is wrong to say they have nothing to show for time. Sheilah has the Balenciaga. It is a black afternoon dress, stiff and boned at the waist, long for the fashions of now, but neither Sheilah nor Peter would change a thread. The Balenciaga is their talisman, their treasure; and after they remember it they touch hands and think that the years are not behind them but hazy and marvelous and still to be lived.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first place they went to was Paris. In the early fifties the pick of the international jobs was there. Peter had inherited the last scrap of money he knew he was ever likely to see, and it was enough to get them over: Sheilah and Peter and the babies and the steamer trunk. To their joy and astonishment they had money in the bank. They said to each other, &#x2018;&#x2018;It should last a year.&#x2019;&#x2019; Peter was fastidious about the new job; he hadn&#x2019;t come all this distance to accept just anything. In Paris he met Hugh Taylor, who was earning enough smuggling gasoline to keep his wife in Paris and a girl in Rome. That impressed Peter, because he remembered Taylor as a sour scholarship student without the slightest talent for life. Taylor had a job, of course. He hadn&#x2019;t said to himself, I&#x2019;ll go over to Europe and smuggle gasoline. It gave Peter an idea; he saw the shape of things. First you catch your fish. Later, at an international party, he met Johnny Hertzberg, who told him Germany was the place. Hertzberg said that anyone who came out of Germany broke now was too stupid to be here, and deserved to be back home at a desk. Peter nodded, as if he had already thought of that. He began to think about Germany. Paris was fine for a holiday, but it had been picked clean. Yes, Germany. His money was running low. He thought about Germany quite a lot.<br> &nbsp;<br> That winter was moist and delicate; so fragile that they daren&#x2019;t speak of it now. There seemed to be plenty of everything and plenty of time. They were living the dream of a marriage, the fabric uncut, nothing slashed or spoiled. All winter they spent their money, and went to parties, and talked about Peter&#x2019;s future job. It lasted four months. They spent their money, lived in the future, and were never as happy again.<br> &nbsp;<br> After four months they were suddenly moved away from Paris, but not to Germany &#x2013; to Geneva. Peter thinks it was because of the incident at the Trudeau wedding at the Ritz. Paul Trudeau was a French-Canadian Peter had known at school and in the Navy. Trudeau had turned into a snob, proud of his career and his Paris connections. He tried to make the difference felt, but Peter thought the difference was only for strangers. At the wedding reception Peter lay down on the floor and said he was dead. He held a white azalea in a brass pot on his chest, and sang, &#x2018;&#x2018;Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee for those in peril on the sea.&#x2019;&#x2019; Sheilah bent over him and said, &#x2018;&#x2018;Peter, darling, get up. Pete, listen, every single person who can do something for you is in this room. If you love me, you&#x2019;ll get up.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;I do love you,&#x2019;&#x2019; he said, ready to engage in a serious conversation. &#x2018;&#x2018;She&#x2019;s so beautiful,&#x2019;&#x2019; he told a second face. &#x2018;&#x2018;She&#x2019;s nearly as tall as I am. Shewas a model in London. I met her over in London in the war. I met her there in the war.&#x2019;&#x2019; He lay on his back with the azalea on his chest, explaining their history. A waiter took the brass pot away, and after Peter had been hauled to his feet he knocked the waiter down. Trudeau&#x2019;s bride, who was freshly out of an Ursuline convent, became hysterical; and even though Paul Trudeau and Peter were old acquaintances, Trudeau never spoke to him again. Peter says now that French-Canadians always have that bit of spite. He says Trudeau asked the embassy to interfere. Luckily, back home there were still a few people to whom the name &#x2018;&#x2018;Frazier&#x2019;&#x2019; meant something, and it was to these people that Peter appealed. He wrote letters saying that a French-Canadian combine was preventing his getting a decent job, and could anything be done? No one answered directly, but it was clear that what they settled for was exile to Geneva: a season of meditation and remorse, as he explained to Sheilah, and it was managed tactfully, through Lucille. Lucille wrote that a friend of hers, May Fergus, now a secretary in Geneva, had heard about a job. The job was filing pictures in the information service of an international agency in the Palais des Nations. The pay was so-so, but Lucille thought Peter must be getting fed up doing nothing. <br> &nbsp;<br> Peter often asks his sister now who put her up to it&#x2014;what important person told her to write that letter suggesting Peter go to Geneva?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;Nobody,&#x2019;&#x2019; says Lucille. &#x2018;&#x2018;I mean, nobody in the way <i>you </i>mean. I really did have this girl friend working there, and I knew you must be running through your money pretty fast in Paris.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;It must have been somebody pretty high up,&#x2019;&#x2019; Peter says.

Tolkien&#39;s Sanctifying Myth: Understanding Middle Earth</h2><p>Explores the twentieth-century Christian humanist&#39;s views on creation as seen in his construction of Middle Earth.</p><p>Bradley J. Birzer is Assistant Professor of History at Hillsdale College. A Senior Fellow with the Center for the American Idea in Houston, he has written extensively on Tolkien, James Fenimore Cooper, the American Frontier and American Indians, and Christopher Dawson. Joseph Pearce is Writer in Residence at Ave Maria College. Among his books are Tolkien: Man and Myth, and Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile.The past year has brought a bumper crop of spirituality-of-Tolkien books, no doubt fueled by the heightened interest generated by the new film series. Birzer's book differs somewhat from recent volumes on the Christian themes to be found in The Lord of the Rings, including Mark Eddy Smith's Tolkien's Ordinary Virtues and Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware's Finding God in the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's spirituality, says Birzer, was not generically Christian but specifically Roman Catholic: the lembas that sustains the company represents the Eucharist; Galadriel and Elbereth exemplify traits of the Virgin Mary; and the company looks to the restoration of a kingdom similar to the Holy Roman Empire. The best chapter of Birzer's study explores how Tolkien's "sanctifying myth" was informed by such Roman Catholic beliefs; Tolkien told a Jesuit friend, for example, that the trilogy was "a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision." Other chapters place Tolkien more generally within the usual canon of 20th-century Christian humanists, including his on-again, off-again friend, C. S. Lewis. Birzer is a fine writer who does a wonderful job of integrating primary sources such as letters, reminiscences and journals into his text; he also includes glimpses of unpublished materials, such as a scuttled LOTR chapter about Sam, as well as Tolkien's little-known attack on Lewis, "The Ulsterior Motive." This is, overall, a fine tribute to the man who, Birzer suggests, "resuscitated the notion that the fantastic may tell us more about reality than do scientific facts." <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Company She Keeps</h2><p>This is the author&#x2019;s first novel, which relates the experiences of a young bohemian intellectual.

Although Zen teacher Steve Hagen has a knack for putting the philosophy of Buddhism in a "plain and simple" package, it may take a while to sink in. There is so much there. Seeing reality, realizing the wisdom of the self, breaking free of dualistic thinking--this is pretty heady stuff. Thankfully, Hagen passes it along in the form of examples from life, psychological tidbits, and stories from Buddhist teachers past and present. And when it clicks in, it can be life-transforming. Hagen explains this shift in outlook and how the fundamental way we look at the world affects everything we do. As an outline, Hagen follows the basic teachings of the Buddha, and we see that, rather than dogmatic truths, they are reminders for us as we reconsider the life we have taken for granted for so long.

I had my own darkroom, which meant that I was also processing all of my own black-and-white film and making prints of the best shots.<br><br> Six months after I exposed my first black-and-white photograph, I walked into the local camera store in Salem, Oregon, and was delighted to find seven rolls of outdated film sitting in a half-price basket on the countertop. I quickly grabbed all seven rolls, paid the salesperson around fourteen dollars, and headed out the door, gleeful at the money I had saved and in anticipation of a camping trip that weekend, when I would surely shoot all seven rolls.<br><br>After my return on Monday, I was visiting my brother&#x2014;the one who inspired me to get into photography in the first place&#x2014;and shared the fun I'd had shooting all seven rolls. I laid them out on his kitchen counter, asking whether I needed to take any extra steps to process the outdated film. He looked at them and quickly said, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t process any of these rolls because they&#x2019;re not black and white. This is color slide film!&#x201d; I was stunned. As far as I was concerned, a slideshow was the last thing I wanted to make. I was sure the compositions from the camping trip had been my best work yet, but now they would never be the amazing black-and-white images I had hoped to print. Seeing my crestfallen face, my brother pointed out that it <i>was </i>possible to have prints made from color slides&#x2014;it was just expensive and time-consuming. The wait could be up to one week and I, at the young age of eighteen, had yet to master the art of patience.<br><br>Days passed before my frustration subsided enough to return to the camera store with the seven rolls of Agfachrome 50 film. And several days later, I returned to pick up my slides after a long day&#x2019;s work as a maintenance man for the City of Salem. What happened next was truly a defining moment in my then-young photographic career. As I placed each slide across the camera store&#x2019;s light table, I was confronted with some truly remarkable color-filled compositions. The fields of wildflowers and the blue sky with white puffy clouds seemed to leap off the light table. A plate of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes (one of my meals on the camping trip) screamed with the vividness of complementary colors. It was transformative; I was awash in the tremendous power of color. Within minutes, I asked the camera-store owner if he had any more outdated film&#x2014;if he did, I would take every last roll.<br><br>Unfortunately, he had no more, but he did offer an attractive discount if I would buy ten rolls at once, and an even better one if I would buy twenty (called a &#x201c;brick&#x201d; of film). Little did I know just how many bricks I would buy over the next thirty-plus years. My love for color photography had begun.<br><br>Soon after, I picked up an orange filter at the camera store and started using it to photograph sunsets and sunrises. And later, while fumbling through a cardboard box on the countertop of that same camera store, I discovered a deeply colored magenta filter and a deep blue filter. Although I never found much use for the blue filter, I had no trouble beginning my love affair with the magenta filter. It was remarkably useful when shooting during the predawn and twilight &#x201c;blue hour,&#x201d; when the sun is below the horizon and the sky takes on&nbsp;a predominantly blue hue, as well as for shooting cityscapes and landscapes.</p><h2>Irresistible (The Horsemen Trilogy)</h2><p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Mary Balogh comes the third novel in the Horsemen Trilogy, in which a proper English lady discovers how desirable she really is after one very improper night...</b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>Sophia Armitage does not consider herself attractive. Even her late husband treated her more as a companion than a lover when she accompanied him to war. But Sophia hopes to enjoy a Season in London as her niece makes her social debut&#x2014;until, that is, her hopes are dashed when she is faced with a threat she can reveal to no one. Then she meets Sir Nathaniel Gascoigne, an old army friend, and falls in love with him even as she must discourage his growing passion for her. Nathaniel can sense Sophia's unhappiness and fear, but does not understand that his attempts to protect and help her can only bring about her downfall...</p><p>Mary Balogh reconfirms her reputation as a superlative writer of Regency romance in this well-drawn, ultimately moving love story between a war hero's widow and her longtime friend. Nathaniel Gascoigne knew Sophie as a colleague's supportive wife when he fought in the Peninsular War. Now, meeting the widowed Sophie in London after a long separation, Nat is surprised by her unexpected agreement that they share discreet lovemaking, no strings attached. But a secret involving Sophie's former marriage has left her vulnerable to a blackmailer, and just when the satisfaction she offers to Nat makes him most eager to prolong their dalliance, Sophie decides she has no choice but to break it off. Nat's gradual insights into Sophie's character, and the couple's struggles to act honorably yet remain true to themselves, are beautifully handled. As a delightful contrast, there's the barbed repartee between Nat's independent-minded cousin and his marriage-shy best friend, which develops into a witty and satisfying secondary romance. Balogh's masterful command of the Regency period, and her skill at dramatizing subtle nuances of character, endow her books with rare and rich rewards. <i>--Ellen Edwards</i><p><b>Mary Balogh</b> has written more than one hundred historical novels and novellas, more than thirty of which have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers.

On his sixth birthday, adorned with a helmet and sword, Henry goes in search of adventure. He challenges a fire-breathing dragon to a fight, but the dragon prefers a game of blowing smoke rings. A cyclops wants only to have a staring contest. Even the griffin will not engage in "a battle to the uttermost" of the type Henry desires. Desperate for a real battle, strength against strength, might against might, Henry seeks out the fearsome leviathan. Has he met his match at last &#x2014; or might he find something he didn&#x2019;t know he was looking for?

In this inspiring and candid memoir, the beloved U.S. and Everton goalkeeper opens up for the first time about how a hyperactive kid with Tourette's syndrome from New Jersey defied the odds to become one of the greatest American keepers in history. <em>The Keeper</em> is also a chronicle of the personal sacrifices Howard's made for his career, including the ultimate dissolution of his marriage and its most painful consequence: separation from his two children.</p><p><em>The Keeper</em> will captivate soccer fans and readers who are unfamiliar with the sport but want to know what makes a world-class athlete different from the rest of us&#x2014;and where that difference gives way to common ground.</p><p>Tim Howard is the goalkeeper for Everton in the English Premier League and the U.S. men's national team. He previously played for the MetroStars in Major League Soccer and for the storied Manchester United. In July 2014, he broke the record for most saves (fifteen) in a World Cup game.

Yet when the Grand Fleet faced the German High Seas Fleet across the grey waters of the North Sea near Jutland, the British battleships and cruisers were battered into a draw, losing far more men and ships than the enemy.<br><br>The Grand Fleet far outnumbered and outgunned the German fleet, so something clearly had gone wrong. The public waited for the official histories of the battle to be released to learn the truth, but month after month went by with the Admiralty promising, but failing, to publish an account of Jutland. Questions were raised in Parliament (twenty-two times), yet still no official report was produced, due to objections from Admiral Beatty.<br><br>This led to Admiral Bacon producing his own account of the battle, called <i>The Jutland Scandal</i>, in 1925. Two years later the man instructed to write the official report, Rear-Admiral Harper, decided to publish his account independently, under the title <i>The Truth about Jutland</i>.<br><br>Together, these two books lay bare the facts about Jutland and reveal the failings of senior officers and the distortions of the early historians. Produced as one volume for the first time, this book tells the truth about the scandal that developed following the largest battle ever fought at sea.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

She leads workshops in women's mystery traditions, aromatherapy, writing, and Tarot throughout the United States and in Europe and lives in Nevada City, California.The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was founded in London in 1888. One of several secret magical societies in existence at the time, the Golden Dawn was noted for the equality it offered women both in its internal hierarchy and when performing mystical ceremonies. While this magical order attracted several more famous followers, William Butler Yeats and George Bernard Shaw among them, Greer's purpose in writing this book is to highlight the lives of four female members. They are Florence Farr, actress; Annie Horniman, patron of the arts; Maud Gonne, aristocratic revolutionary; and Moina Bergson Mathers, artist. All managed to escape suffocating Victorian lifestyles and eventually formed the backbone of the Golden Dawn. In this massive book, Greer explores the many years of intensive study of occult and mystical traditions the women undertook and the personal triumphs and tragedies they experienced along the way. Packed with anecdotes about major literary figures of the time, this account provides a provocative picture of four strong and brilliant women who refused to be hindered by the dictates of Victorian society. However, while this book may prove intriguing as a historical or biographical work, its use of astrology and magic to draw conclusions or explain occurrences may prove distracting to some readers. <i>Kathleen Hughes</i></p><h2>The Adventurer&#39;s Guide to Treasure (and How to Steal It) (The Adventurer&#39;s Guide, 3)</h2><p><b>Fantasy gets a clever refresh in the final book of this witty, action-packed, and hilarious middle grade adventure trilogy.</b><b><br></b>At Saint Lupin's Completely Ordinary School Where Nothing Bizarre Ever Happens Most Especially Not Illegal Quests That Destroy Famous Landmarks, students are <i>not</i> taught about pirates.

She lives in Little Silver, New Jersey.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>For as long as I can remember, I never liked to eat meat. It was at the age of thirteen that I became inspired to be a physician and to cease eating the flesh of other animals. Both concepts occurred to me when I awoke after having my appendix removed. I recognized that the doctor looking over my bed had saved my life, and I decided that someday, I too would save lives. I also truly appreciated the sanctity of life and resolved that I would seek to live my life without taking the life of any other creature.<br><br>I did not realize how circuitous my journey to become a physician would be. The journey took me from Brooklyn College in New York City to Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in Missouri. It was within this altruistic and holistic medical school environment that I was taught that doctors do not heal patients, but are facilitators in their healing process. The power to heal lies within each individual. I was taught that all are blessed with the natural abilities to cure most diseases themselves but must make wise health choices throughout life, lest their natural healing modalities become depleted.<br><br>After I graduated from medical school, my quest for knowledge and training took me to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, and Tennessee. I left residency to work at a Cuban refugee clinic and then to become a medical missionary in Honduras, Mexico, and Peru. Three days after returning from Peru, I met my husband-to-be. We were soon blessed with three daughters. I completed obstetrics residency and trained in advanced gynecologic cancer surgery in New York and Maryland. I opened a medical practice in New Jersey, in which I delivered more than five thousand babies and cared for several thousand other pregnant women. My ability to witness so many births was a spiritual blessing. Through those many years and many births, I always knew that I was on a mission to reach an even greater number of women, to share my experience and knowledge with them.<br><br>This book is for every woman contemplating pregnancy while striving for the best of health and showing the greatest mercy to others. The information it contains will help you safely, authoritatively, and wisely fulfill your dreams of giving birth to a strong, healthy child while adhering to a compassionate and healthy lifestyle. Whether you are decreasing your intake of red meat, limiting your intake of dairy products, or fully committed to a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, there is an abundance of valuable information within this book that will help you optimize your baby's and your health during your pregnancy.<br><br>Having been a vegetarian, a physician, and a mother, each for over twenty-five years, I've thought about most of the questions you are now facing. When I was carrying my own children I asked these questions, but there were no answers. After years of studying nutrition, studying medicine, and gaining obstetric experience, I have learned how to guide and educate young women who share the same quest for answers about diet and health that engaged me.<br><br>The answers to many of your questions do not lie conveniently in medical journals. Although the basis for the knowledge is there, the complete answers can be found only at a deeper level of consciousness. You will obtain this knowledge as you learn about creation, birth, health, and nutrition. By striving to achieve a peaceful and wise lifestyle and being open-minded to new concepts, you will increase your chances of finding that humane and healthy life you so desire. By combining the medical knowledge you find here with your own maternal intuition, you will be able to answer each and every question about your health during pregnancy. I know that our journey together will benefit you and your baby. My best wishes are with you both.<br><br>IS THIS BOOK RIGHT FOR ME?<br><br>If you are browsing through this book, you will probably think about how your diet affects your health and might affect your tiny fetus. You may have recognized already that the typical American meat-based diet may not truly be the best diet for your baby or yourself. Because you have strayed from the dietary norm, I know you make your own choices. I hope to share my medical knowledge with you so you can continue to make your own choices -- but make them at a higher level of medical and nutritional expertise.<br><br>You may already be among the peripheral group termed "vegetarians," and although you may or may not be among the strictest of the group, you are a thinker, a humanitarian, and a person with purpose. As you begin to prepare for your vegetarian pregnancy, it is important that you know which type of vegetarian lifestyle best suits your health needs and ethical choices. I will review the basic types of vegetarian lifestyles to help you discern which group applies to you.<br><br><b>An individual decreasing meat in her diet:</b> You may be among the large and growing percentage of people moving toward a semi-vegetarian diet. You may be limiting your meat intake to fewer portions, may still eat fish or poultry or both, or may have completely eliminated red meat. Although yours is not a totally vegetarian diet, it warrants serious consideration during pregnancy. You definitely need the same nutritional knowledge for yourself and your unborn baby as does any other type of vegetarian. Also, you may be approaching a full vegetarian diet, and the completion of that path might occur before the end of your pregnancy.<br><br><b>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian:</b> If you are a lacto-ovo-vegetarian, you do not eat beef, pork, fish, or poultry. Basically, you do not believe in eating the body of any animal or in taking the life of any animal. You may, however, eat products derived from animals, including eggs and dairy products -- milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt. You are among a varied group of individuals. Some lacto-ovo-vegetarians believe in eating animal-derived products as long as the animal has not lost its life. Other lacto-ovo-vegetarians do not wish to eat the actual animal-derived food for specific health reasons, such as decreasing cholesterol or avoiding the pesticides, antibiotics, and synthetic hormones stored in animal fat. Because most eggs are not fertilized and would never have become chickens, lacto-ovo-vegetarians may not find the eating of eggs morally offensive, although most would prefer eggs from noncaged or free-roaming chickens. Most people who are lacto-ovo-vegetarians usually choose this diet for a combination of philosophical, humanitarian, and health reasons.<br><br><b>Vegan:</b> Vegans are the purest vegetarians. If you are vegan, you avoid consumption of all animal-derived products. You will not eat any meat, fish, fowl, eggs, or dairy products. Your healthy diet consists of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, grains, and seeds and is low in fats but high in protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Because present-day farming techniques have depleted the soil of nutrients, you may need to pay closer attention to your diet to obtain sufficient quantities of vitamin D, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients are not abundantly available in foods of plant origin. However, it is actually quite simple for you as a vegan to obtain adequate amounts of these nutrients. Many vegans have adopted a lifestyle in which their clothing, shoes, and cosmetics do not contribute to animal cruelty.<br><br><b>Macrobiotic vegetarian:</b> If you follow a macrobiotic diet, you believe that eating a diet consisting of whole grains is superior physically and philosophically. You may also believe that the grains and plants you eat should vary with the seasons of the year and with the place in which you reside and should be indigenous to the area in which you live. Macrobiotics is not just a diet; it is a philosophy and a lifestyle based on principles of balance and harmony between nature and the universe. There is a strong Asian influence in the macrobiotic lifestyle, reflecting the principles of yin and yang. Because a macrobiotic diet is low in fats and animal products and high in nuts, grains, and seeds, you may have chosen this diet to attain a healthier lifestyle.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Holly Roberts, D.O., FACOG</p><h2>Cosmopolitics I (Volume 9) (Posthumanities)</h2><p>From Einstein&#x2019;s quest for a unified field theory to Stephen Hawking&#x2019;s belief that we &#x201c;would know the mind of God&#x201d; through such a theory, contemporary science&#x2014;and physics in particular&#x2014;has claimed that it alone possesses absolute knowledge of the universe. In a sweeping work of philosophical inquiry, originally published in French in seven volumes, Isabelle Stengers builds on her previous intellectual accomplishments to explore the role and authority of science in modern societies and to challenge its pretensions to objectivity, rationality, and truth.&nbsp;For Stengers, science is a constructive enterprise, a diverse, interdependent, and highly contingent system that does not simply discover preexisting truths but, through specific practices and processes, helps shape them. She addresses conceptual themes crucial for modern science, such as the formation of physical-mathematical intelligibility, from Galilean mechanics and the origin of dynamics to quantum theory, the question of biological reductionism, and the power relations at work in the social and behavioral sciences. Focusing on the polemical and creative aspects of such themes, she argues for an ecology of practices that takes into account how scientific knowledge evolves, the constraints and obligations such practices impose, and the impact they have on the sciences and beyond.&nbsp;This perspective, which demands that competing practices and interests be taken seriously rather than merely (and often condescendingly) tolerated, poses a profound political and ethical challenge. In place of both absolutism and tolerance, she proposes a cosmopolitics&#x2014;modeled on the ideal scientific method that considers all assumptions and facts as being open to question&#x2014;that reintegrates the natural and the social, the modern and the archaic, the scientific and the irrational.&nbsp;<i>Cosmopolitics I</i> includes the first three volumes of the original work. <i>Cosmopolitics II</i> will be published by the University of Minnesota Press in Spring 2011.</p><p><p>Isabelle Stengers is professor of philosophy at the Free University of Brussels. Among her other books available in English are <i>The Invention of Modern Science</i> (Minnesota, 2000) and <i>Power and Invention: Situating Science</i> (Minnesota, 1997).</p><p>Robert Bononno, a teacher and translator, lives in New York City.

The world is at war, and Family Carlyle is struggling to defend itself. With Malcolm Carlyle hovering at death&#x2019;s door, the siblings struggle to maintain control. But deception and war go hand in hand, culminating in a final revelation that will truly change everything for Forever Carlyle.</p><p></p><h2>Easy-to-Make Wooden Sundials (Dover Woodworking)</h2><p>Gnomonics is to the scientific what the Art of Dyalling is to antiquaries: both refer to the art, science, and craft of sundials. The sundial, the oldest mechanical clock, is also the truest &#x2014; when properly set and corrected it is more accurate at its longitude than modern "standard" time clocks. For beneath and behind the shadows on the dial operate principles of celestial mechanics, geography, trigonometry, and magnetism. But can a sundial be built with this knowledge? Yes, in fact, with proper guidance, a good deal of sundial science can be learned in the making. Here is the guide. The book gently leads beginning diallists into sundial lore and construction. Novice craftsmen who can wield a saw, wood-burning pen, matte knife, sandpaper, and a few other simple tools can make five different kinds of sundials; plans are flexible and allow for embellishment, alteration, and variety of materials. Pre-calculated templates can be removed from the book and transferred by carbon paper to wood. Illustrated step-by-step instructions show how to build these sundials: Horizontal; Direct South Vertical; Folding Equatorial; Bowstring Equatorial; and Diptych. Ultimately, one can design a working pocket sundial! Tables are included for four different latitudes (25�, 32�, 40�, 45�), applicable throughout the United States and much of North America. A table of more than one hundred cities gives latitude, longitude, time, zone, magnetic variation, and the necessary time adjustments. A special section is given to dial correction; the equation of time, longitude, magnetic variation, hour angles. A bibliography and a list of sundial mottoes complete this comprehensive beginning manual.</p><p></p><h2>The Right-Size Flower Garden: Simplify Your Outdoor Space with Smart Design Solutions and Plant Choices</h2><p>Today, the reality of a &#x201c;bigger is better&#x201d; garden no longer holds the same allure as a &#x201c;small is beautiful&#x201d; one.

The culprit, typically, is overplanting, choosing the wrong plants &#x2015; or simply the advance of time. (Kari Richardson <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>The pretty pictures we're used to are here in Mendez' book, including befores-and-afters of her own right-sized perennial beds. She also suggests plants for easy care or best use of small space as well as fussy, time-sucking plants to avoid. <br><br>But if you're wondering how to simplify and where to begin, Mendez will talk you through it like a kind friend. And that, as La Martha might say, is a good thing. (Helen &amp; Sarah Battersby <i>Toronto Gardens</i>)<br><br>The Right-Size Flower Garden by Kerry Ann Mendez (St. Lynn's Press) is liberating. Many of us want gorgeous landscaping, bountiful veggie gardens and yards that make our neighbors jealous. Often we spend an extraordinary amount of time and money to obtain those results. When we fall short, we become disappointed and the yard doesn't look its best. (We have all said, "That used to be a great yard until the new people moved in.")<br>Mendez suggests admitting you may not have the desire or energy to maintain the garden you think you should have.

This small, deluxe pop-up book showcases three-dimensional renderings of some of the beloved curiosities from the Harry Potter films, including two pops related to the upcoming <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i>. Pull out flaps will feature text that delves into the items on each spread and how they were achieved in the films.<br><br>This book features doors that open from the middle of the front cover, a sturdy magnetic closure, and elastic loops to hold each pop firmly in place making it a perfect stand-alone display.</p><p>Gr 3 Up&#x2014;The vast Harry Potter franchise comes alive in this pop-up book. Five intricately painted 3-D scenes are accompanied by movie titles, quotations, and descriptions of how each curiosity is brought to life in its respective film. Thoughtful paper engineering by Diaz ensures that each scene contains multiple layers that highlight Silv�n's detailed illustrations. The volume works best, the introduction explains, when stood up and folded down to 90 degrees, which allows the full scene to come together. The work opens with the Hogwarts sorting hat and includes depictions of the Whomping Willow and Cornish pixies. Newt Scamander's (aka J.K. Rowling) Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is incorporated as well, with Newt's Enchanted Case and the Niffler scenes. Though this selection is brief in terms of page count, fans will love the breadth of coverage here and will likely appreciate the inclusion of more obscure curiosities. Casual Potter readers may not be familiar with every reference but should appreciate the craftsmanship nonetheless. The elaborate construction means there are many delicate pieces, which should be noted if considering this for circulation.

Known as the father of the Protestant Reformation, Luther has had an enormous impact on Western Christianity and culture. In&nbsp;<em>Luther on the Christian Life</em>, historian Carl Trueman introduces readers to the lively Reformer, taking them on a tour of his historical context, theological system, and approach to the Christian life. Whether exploring Luther&#x2019;s theology of protest, ever-present sense of humor, or misunderstood view of sanctification, this book will help modern readers go deeper in their spiritual walk by learning from one of the great teachers of the faith.</p><p>John Newton is best known as the slave trader turned hymn writer who penned the most popular English hymn in history: &#x201c;Amazing Grace.&#x201d; However, many Christians are less familiar with the decades he spent in relative obscurity, laboring as a &#x201c;spiritual doctor&#x201d; while pastoring small parishes in England. In the latest addition to Crossway&#x2019;s growing Theologians on the Christian Life series, Tony Reinke introduces modern readers to Newton&#x2019;s pastoral wisdom by leading them through the many sermons, hymns, and&#x2015;most importantly&#x2015;letters that he wrote over the course of his life. Considered by many to be one of the greatest letter writers of all time, Newton has valuable insights to offer modern Christians, especially when it comes to fusing together sound doctrine, lived experience, and godly practice.</p><p>Widely recognized as a pillar of 20th-century evangelicalism, J. I. Packer has had a profound impact on millions of Christians living today. Now in his late eighties, Packer still exerts an enormous influence on pastors and laypeople around the world through his many books, articles, and recorded lectures&#x2015;works that overflow with spiritual wisdom related to the Christian life. In the latest addition to Crossway&#x2019;s growing Theologians on the Christian Life series, well-known pastor Sam Storms examines Packer&#x2019;s legacy when it comes to the Christian and sanctification. Whether exploring Packer&#x2019;s insights into prayer, Bible study, the sovereignty of God, or the Christian&#x2019;s fight against sin, this accessible book offers readers the chance to learn from the best of Packer&#x2019;s thinking on what true godliness really entails.</p><p>The importance of Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck to Reformed theology is difficult to overstate. Bavinck's comprehensive four volume systematic theology,&nbsp;<em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>, is a modern classic that has influenced countless pastors and theologians over the past 100 years. In&nbsp;<em>Bavinck on the Christian Life</em>, scholar John Bolt brings the great Dutch theologian&#x2019;s life and work to bear on following Jesus in the 21st century. By practically applying Bavinck's systematic works to the Christian life and looking at the life of the man himself, this book shows the direct connection between robust theology, practical holiness, and personal joy.</p><p>John Owen is widely hailed as one of the greatest theologians of all time. His many works&#x2015;especially those encouraging Christians in their struggle against sin&#x2015;continue to speak powerfully to readers today, offering much-needed spiritual guidance for following Christ and resisting temptation day in and day out. Starting with an overview of Owen&#x2019;s life, ministry, and historical context, Michael Haykin and Matthew Barrett introduce&nbsp;readers to the pillars of Owen&#x2019;s spiritual life. From exploring his understanding of believers&#x2019; fellowship with the triune God to highlighting his&nbsp;teaching on justification, this study invites us to learn about the Christian life from the greatest of the English Puritans.</p><p>Part of the&nbsp;Theologians on the Christian Life&nbsp;series.</p></p><p><p><strong>Carl R.

It is a remarkably edifying and illuminating piece of work. Displaying the interests of a pastor and the rigor of a historian, Carl Trueman provides us with an analysis of Luther on the Christian life that is as &#x2018;human&#x2019; as the German Reformer himself. Yet it&#x2019;s far more than Luther on the Christian life. It&#x2019;s one of the very best summaries of Luther in context.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>&#x201c;Carl Trueman has pulled off a tremendous feat: he&#x2019;s not only given us a volume that is scholarly and historically nuanced while still accessible and refreshingly contemporary; he&#x2019;s also managed to capture the brilliance and boldness of Martin Luther in a relatively short space. Trueman is to be commended for presenting a Luther who is unlike us in so many ways, and yet a Luther from whom we can learn so much.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kevin DeYoung,</strong> Senior Pastor,&nbsp;Christ Covenant Church, Matthews, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;This book illustrates again why Martin Luther remains a nearly inexhaustible resource. Trueman explains why Luther can be such a perceptive, encouraging, human, and even humorous guide to the Christian life. Especially important is Trueman&#x2019;s clear communication of why the cross of Christ grounded Luther&#x2019;s approach to almost everything and why a &#x2018;theology of the cross&#x2019; might powerfully motivate believers today as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mark A. Noll,</strong> Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame; editor, <em>Protestantism after 500 Years</em> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Trueman gives us not only Luther&#x2019;s theology, but Luther as a theologian, which in turn connects with us as theologians. We learn from Trueman&#x2019;s insight into Luther that theology isn&#x2019;t just what we know about God, or even how we know it, but is intimately connected to who we are. Trueman gives us Luther&#x2015;constipation, wit, contradictions, and all. We also finally get a theological apologetic for a robust sense of humor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Aimee Byrd,</strong> author, <em>Why Can&#x2019;t We Be Friends?</em> and <em>No Little Women</em></p><p>&#x201c;It is no easy task to write a small volume summing up the theology and significance for the Christian life of Martin Luther. Yet Trueman has done it superbly with aplomb and verve. Highly recommended as an excellent introduction to a remarkable Christian and human being.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael A. G. Haykin,</strong> Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;This book takes us on an engaging, enjoyable tour of the thought of one of Christianity&#x2019;s most influential theologians. Writing with wisdom and accessible style, Trueman gets to the heart of Luther&#x2019;s theology, showing how his teachings in areas like law and gospel, justification by grace through faith, and the means of grace connect with the everyday Christian life of believers. Trueman&#x2019;s insightful scholarship and clear writing give us a wonderful introduction to Luther&#x2019;s thought. I highly recommend it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Justin S. Holcomb,</strong> Episcopal Priest; Professor, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary; coauthor, <em>Rid of My Disgrace</em> and <em>God Made All of Me</em>; editor, <em>Christian Theologies of Scripture</em></p><p>&#x201c;In this compelling book, we encounter an arresting portrait of Luther the pastor, a full-blooded man who knew the spiritual and physical joys and pains of life and the formidable daily challenges of being a Christian in a fallen world. In elegant, bracing prose full of pastoral and theological insight and leavened with his characteristic humor, Trueman both keeps Luther in his time and engages us in conversation about how the German doctor speaks to ours. Trueman&#x2019;s profound exploration of one of the great writers on the Christian life challenges all of us to cancel our tickets for journeys of self-exploration and self-expression to pursue something more authentic. From a distance of five hundred years, Luther tells us that the story is not about us; it&#x2019;s about what God has done for us.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce Gordon,</strong> Titus Street Professor of Ecclesiastical History, Yale Divinity School</p><p>&#x201c;This book deftly combines deep historical learning with sage pastoral wisdom to present us with an unaccommodated Luther&#x2015;one who is sure to surprise as well as offend those only familiar with sanitized portraits of the Wittenberg Reformer. But this is the Luther that we need, for it is the real Luther&#x2015;not the fictions of hagiographers&#x2015;who has the most to teach us about the Christian life. Both new and longtime readers of Luther will derive much benefit from Trueman&#x2019;s book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Scott R. Swain,</strong> President and James Woodrow Hassell Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando; coauthor, <em>Reformed Catholicity</em></p><p>&#x201c;Eminently readable, humorous, and always with an eye to the church today, Trueman brings us into Luther&#x2019;s world, devils and all, and shows us the centrality of the cross and the objective power of God&#x2019;s Word for Luther&#x2019;s understanding of the Christian life. Most importantly, we meet Luther on Luther&#x2019;s terms. His high view of the liturgy and sacraments stands alongside his more familiar views on the authority of Scripture and justification by faith alone. All those interested in Luther or the Reformation need to read this excellent book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Carl Beckwith,</strong> Associate Professor of History and Doctrine, Beeson Divinity School; author, <em>Hilary of Poitiers on the Trinity</em></p></p><h2>Scaredy Squirrel at Night</h2><p>Scaredy never sleeps --- sleep might mean bad dreams about dragons, ghosts, vampire bats and polka-dot monsters.

Then, given the chance to return to his home, Quan undertakes a physical and mental journey that brings him face to face with figures from his past&#x2014;his angry father, his childhood sweetheart, his boyhood friends now maimed or dead&#x2014;and ultimately to the shattering reality that his innocence has been irretrievably lost in the wake of the war.

The work does not translate well to audio. Chabon is a master of complexity, both in the stories he crafts and the style in which he writes. Although these distinctions work well in print, in audio the listener does not have the luxury of being able to turn back pages frequently to re-read complicated sentences. The result is an anomaly. Michael York could not be better, and his style and tone fit well into a mystery based in the English countryside. But York's strengths simply cannot overcome Chabon's complicated plot and narrative style, which are best enjoyed in print.

Award-winning author Jennifer Haigh follows hercritically acclaimed novels <em>Mrs. Kimble </em>and <em>The Condition </em>with a captivating, vividly rendered portrait of fraying family ties, and the trials of belief anddevotion, in <em>Faith</em>.<br></p><p><strong>Product Description</strong><br>It is the spring of 2002 and a perfect storm has hit Boston. Across the city's archdiocese, trusted priests have been accused of the worst possible betrayal of the souls in their care. In <em>Faith</em>, Jennifer Haigh explores the fallout for one devout family, the McGanns. <p>Estranged for years from her difficult and demanding relatives, Sheila McGann has remained close to her older brother Art, the popular, dynamic pastor of a large suburban parish. When Art finds himself at the center of the maelstrom, Sheila returns to Boston, ready to fight for him and his reputation. What she discovers is more complicated than she imagined. Her strict, lace-curtain-Irish mother is living in a state of angry denial. Sheila's younger brother Mike, to her horror, has already convicted his brother in his heart. But most disturbing of all is Art himself, who persistently dodges Sheila's questions and refuses to defend himself.</p> <p>As the scandal forces long-buried secrets to surface, <em>Faith</em> explores the corrosive consequences of one family's history of silence&#x2014;and the resilience its members ultimately find in forgiveness. Throughout, Haigh demonstrates how the truth can shatter our deepest beliefs&#x2014;and restore them. A gripping, suspenseful tale of one woman's quest for the truth, <em>Faith</em> is a haunting meditation on loyalty and family, doubt and belief. Elegantly crafted, sharply observed, this is Jennifer Haigh's most ambitious novel to date.</p> <p></p> <strong> A Q&amp;A with Author Jennifer Haigh</strong><br><strong> </strong> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was your inspiration for writing <em>Faith</em>?</p> <p><strong>Haigh:</strong> When I moved to Boston from Iowa in 2002, the city was reeling from revelations that Catholic priests had molested children, and that the Archdiocese had covered up the abuse. I was reeling too: I was raised in a Catholic family, spent twelve years in parochial schools and had extremely fond memories of my interactions with Catholic clergy. It&#x2019;s no exaggeration to say that nuns and priests were the heroes of my childhood. Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened in Boston--and, as later became clear, in Catholic dioceses across the country. <em>Faith</em> was my attempt to explain the inexplicable, to understand what I couldn&#x2019;t make sense of in any other way.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Exploring the interplay between parents and children and among siblings is a delicate art that is not easily mastered, even for seasoned writers. How do you, as a storyteller, work to keep your story emotionally evocative&#x2014;pulling the reader in with a depth of feeling&#x2014;without falling into melodrama or treacle?</p> <p><strong>Haigh:</strong> I don&#x2019;t try to make the reader feel any particular way. I just try to be accurate, to show people as they are.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Faith</em> is told from the point of view of Art&#x2019;s sister, Sheila. It&#x2019;s a surprising choice, since she doesn&#x2019;t actually witness the events in question. Why did you approach the story in this way?</p> <p><strong>Haigh:</strong> It took me a while to figure out how to tell this story. When I read account of priests who&#x2019;d been accused of sexual abuse, I was struck by the difficulty of getting to the bottom of such cases. Often it comes down to one person&#x2019;s word against another: only two people know for sure what happened, and sometimes the child is too traumatized to remember it clearly. As Sheila tells the story, she&#x2019;s struggling to arrive at the truth, to find out whether her brother could possibly have done the things he&#x2019;s accused of, to imagine what he thought and felt, to get inside his head. In a sense, it mirrors the way all novels are written. To me, writing is an exercise in empathy.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Over the course of four novels, you&#x2019;ve broadened your skills and honed your narrative dexterity, from the exquisite character sketches of <em>Mrs. Kimble</em>, to broader questions of family, religion, and society in the rich, multi-layered family drama that is <em>Faith</em>. What are you working on next?</p> <p><strong>Haigh:</strong> My current project is a collection of short stories set in Bakerton, the Pennsylvania coal town where my second novel, <em>Baker Towers</em>, took place.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What inspires you as a writer&#x2014;and as a reader? Who has influenced your writing and who you are as a person?</p> <p><strong>Haigh:</strong> Like all writers, I am a reader first. When my work is going well, I read. When it&#x2019;s going badly, I read more. Faulkner, William Styron, James Salter, Alice Munro, William Trevor, Richard Yates, JM Coetzee: these are writers whose books remind me what&#x2019;s possible, why I wanted to write novels in the first place.</p><p>It is the spring of 2002 and a perfect storm has hit Boston.

She was born at White Sands Missile Range, which people who know her say explains a lot. She has been an accountant, a professional musician, an insurance investigator, and, until recently, carried on a secret identity in the corporate world as a communications executive. She and her husband, fantasy artist R. Cat Conrad, live in Texas with their iguana, Popeye.<b>One</b><p><b>Claire</b></p><p>Claire Danvers was in a rare bad mood, and nearly getting arrested didn&#x2019;t improve it. First, her university classes hadn&#x2019;t gone well at all, and then she&#x2019;d had a humiliating argument with her &#x201c;adviser&#x201d; (she usually thought of him that way, in quotes, because he didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;advise&#x201d; her to do anything but take boring core subjects and not challenge herself), and then she&#x2019;d gotten a completely unfair B on a physics paper she knew had been letter perfect. She would have grudgingly accepted a B on something unimportant, like history, but no, it had to be in her major. And of course Professor Carlyle wasn&#x2019;t in his office to talk about it.</p><p>So she wasn&#x2019;t fully paying attention when she stepped off the curb. Traffic in Morganville, Texas, wasn&#x2019;t exactly fast and furious, and here by Texas Prairie University, people were fully used to stopping for oblivious students.</p><p>Still, the screech of brakes surprised her and sent her stumbling back to the safety of the sidewalk, and it was only after a couple of fast breaths that she realized she&#x2019;d nearly been run over by a police cruiser.</p><p>And a policeman was getting out of the car, looking grim.</p><p>As he stalked over to her she realized he was probably a vampire&#x2014;he was too pale to be a human, and he had on sunglasses even here in the shade of the building. Glancing at the cruiser to confirm, she saw the extreme tinting job on the windows. Definitely vampire police. The official slogan of the police was <i>to protect and serve</i>, but her boyfriend called the vampire patrol the <i>to protect and serve up for dinner patrol</i>.</p><p>It was unusual to see one so close to the university, though. Normally, vampire cops worked at night, and closer to the center of town, where Founder&#x2019;s Square was located, along with the central vamp population. Only the regular residents would see them there, and not the transient&#x2014;though pretty oblivious&#x2014;students.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said, and swallowed a rusty taste in her mouth that seemed composed of shock and entirely useless anger. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t looking where I was going.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Obviously,&#x201d; he said. Like most vamps, he had an accent, but she&#x2019;d long ago given up trying to identify it; if they lived long enough, vampires tended to pick up dozens of accents, and many of them were antique anyway. His facial features seemed . . . maybe Chinese? &#x201c;Identification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For walking?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Identification.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire swallowed her protest and reached in her backpack for her wallet. She pulled out her student ID card and Texas driver&#x2019;s license and handed them over. He glanced at them and shoved the</p><p>cards back.</p><p>&#x201c;Not those,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your town identification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My . . . what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should have received it in the mail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I haven&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p><p>He took off his sunglasses. Behind them, his eyes were very dark, but there were hints of red. He stared at her for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;All right. When you get your card, carry it at all times. And next time, watch your step. You get yourself hit by a car, I&#x2019;ll consider you roadkill.&#x201d;</p><p>With that, he put the sunglasses back on, turned, and got back in his car. Before Claire could think about any way to respond, he&#x2019;d put the cruiser in gear and whipped around the corner.</p><p>It did not improve her mood.</p><p>Before she could even think about going home, Claire had a mandatory stop to make, at her part-time job. She dreaded it today, because she knew she was in no shape to deal with the incredibly inconsistent moods of Myrnin, her vampire mad-scientist boss. He might be laser focused and super-rational; he might be talking to crockery and quoting <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (that had been the scene during her last visit). But whatever he was doing, he&#x2019;d have work for her, and probably too much of it.</p><p>But at least he was never, ever boring.</p><p>She&#x2019;d made the walk so often that she did it on autopilot, hardly even noticing the streets and houses and the alley down which she had to pass; she checked her phone and read texts as she jogged down the long marble steps that led into the darkness of his lab, or lair, whichever mood he was in today. The lights were on, which was nice. As she put her phone away, she saw that Myrnin was bent over a microscope&#x2014;an ancient thing that she&#x2019;d tried to put away a dozen times in favor of a newer electronic model, but he kept unearthing the thing. He stepped away from the eyepiece to scribble numbers frantically on a chalkboard. The board was <i>covered</i> in numbers, and to Claire&#x2019;s eyes they looked completely random&#x2014;not just in terms of their numerical values, but in the way they&#x2019;d been written, at all angles and in all areas of the available space. Some were even upside down. It wasn&#x2019;t a formula or an analysis. It was complete gibberish.</p><p>So. It was going to be one of those days. Lovely.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Claire said with fatalistic resignation as she dumped her backpack on the floor and opened up a drawer to retrieve her lab coat. It was a good thing she looked first; Myrnin had dumped an assortment of scalpels in on top of the fabric. Any one of them could have sliced her to the bone. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you know that certain types of coral qualify as immortal? The definition of scientific immortality is that if the mortality rate of a species doesn&#x2019;t increase after it reaches maturity, there is no such thing as aging . . . black coral, for instance. Or the Great Basin bristlecone pine. I&#x2019;m trying to determine if there is any resemblance between the development of those cellular colonies with the replacement of human cells that takes place in a conversion to vampirism. . . .&#x201d; He was talking a mile a minute, with a fever pitch that Claire always dreaded. It meant he was in need of medication, which he wouldn&#x2019;t take; she&#x2019;d need to be stealthy about adding it to his blood supply, again, to bring him down a little into the rational zone. &#x201c;Did you bring me a hamburger?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did I&#x2014; No, Myrnin, I didn&#x2019;t bring you a hamburger.&#x201d; Bizarre. He&#x2019;d never asked for that before.</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doughnuts?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What good are you, then?&#x201d; He finally looked up from the microscope, made another note or two on the board, and stepped back to consider the chaos of chalk marks. &#x201c;Oh dear. That&#x2019;s not very&#x2014;is this where I started? Claire?&#x201d; He pointed at a number somewhere near the top right corner.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t here,&#x201d; Claire said, and buttoned up her lab coat. &#x201c;Do you want me to keep working on the machine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The what? Oh, yes, that thing. Do, please.&#x201d; He crossed his arms and stared at the board, frowning now. It was not a personal-grooming highlight day for him, either. His long, dark hair was in tangles and needed a wash; she was sure the oversized somewhat-white shirt he was wearing had been used as a rag to wipe up chemical spills at sometime in its long life. He&#x2019;d had the presence of mind to put on some kind of pants, though she wasn&#x2019;t sure the baggy walking shorts were what she&#x2019;d have chosen. At least the flip-flops kind of matched. &#x201c;How was school?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said absently, &#x201c;very good . . . Ah, I think this is where I started. . . . Fibonacci sequence&#x2014;I see what I did. . . .&#x201d; He began drawing a spiral through the numbers, starting somewhere at the center. Of course, he&#x2019;d be noting down results in a spiral. Why not?</p><p>Claire felt a headache coming on. The place was dirty again, grit on the floor that was a combination of sand blown in from the desert winds, and whatever Myrnin had been working with that he&#x2019;d spilled liberally all over the place. She only hoped it wasn&#x2019;t too toxic. She&#x2019;d have to schedule a day to get him out of here so she could get reorganized, sweep up the debris, stack the books back in some kind of order, shelve the lab equipment. . . . No, that wouldn&#x2019;t be a day. More like a week.</p><p>She gave up thinking about it, then went to the lab table on the right side of the room, which was covered by a dusty sheet. She pulled the cover off, coughed at the billows of grit that flew up, and looked at the machine she was building. It was definitely her own creation, this thing: it lacked most of the eccentric design elements that Myrnin would have put into it, though he&#x2019;d sneaked in a few flywheels and glowing liquids along the way. It was oblong, practical, bell-shaped, and had oscillation controls along the sides. She thought it looked a bit like an old-fashioned science fiction ray gun, but it had a very different use . . . if it had ever worked.</p><p>Claire hooked up the device to the plug-in analyzing programs, and began to run simulations. It was a project Myrnin had proposed months ago, and it had taken her this long to get even close to a solution. . . . The vampires had an ability, so far mysterious and decidedly unscientific, to influence the minds and emotions of others&#x2014;humans, mostly, but sometimes other vampires. Every vampire had a different set of strengths and weaknesses, but most shared some kind of emotional-control mechanism; it helped them calm their prey, or convince them to surrender their blood voluntarily.</p><p>What she was working on was a way to <i>cancel</i> that ability. To give humans&#x2014;and even other vampires&#x2014;a way to defend themselves against the manipulation.</p><p>Claire had gone from building a machine that could pinpoint and map emotions to one that could build feedback loops, heightening what was already there. It was a necessary step to get to the <i>control</i> stage&#x2014;you had to be able to replicate the ability to negate it. If you thought of emotion as a wavelength, you could either amplify or cancel it with the flick of a switch.</p><p>&#x201c;Myrnin?&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t look up from the analysis running on the laptop computer screen. &#x201c;Did you mess with my project?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A little,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it better?&#x201d;</p><p>It was. She had no idea what he&#x2019;d done to it, but adjusting the controls showed precise calibrations that she couldn&#x2019;t have done herself. &#x201c;Did you maybe write down how you did it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; Myrnin said cheerfully. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think it will help. It&#x2019;s just hearing the cycles and tuning to them. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re capable, with your limited human senses. If you&#x2019;d become a vampire, you&#x2019;d have so much more potential, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t answer that. She&#x2019;d found it was really best not to engage in that particular debate with him, and besides, in the next second he&#x2019;d forgotten all about it, focused on his enthusiasm for black coral.</p><p>On paper, the device they&#x2019;d developed&#x2014;well, she&#x2019;d developed, and Myrnin had tweaked&#x2014;seemed to work. Now she&#x2019;d have to figure out how to test it, make sure it exactly replicated the way the vampire ability worked . . . and then make sure she could cancel that ability, reliably.</p><p>It might even have other applications. If you could make an attacking vampire afraid, make him back off, you could end a fight without violence. That alone made the work worthwhile.</p><p><i>And what happens when someone uses it the other way? she wondered. What happens if an attacker gets hold of it, then uses it to make you more afraid, as a victim?</i> She didn&#x2019;t have an answer for that. It was one of the things that made her feel, sometimes, that this was a bad idea&#x2014; and that she ought to simply destroy the thing before it caused more trouble.</p><p>But maybe not quite yet.</p><p>Claire unhooked the machine&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t have any kind of cool name for it yet, or even a project designation&#x2014;and tested the weight of it. Heavy. She&#x2019;d built it from solid components, and it generated considerable waste heat, but it was a prototype; it&#x2019;d improve, if it was worthwhile.</p><p>She tried aiming it at the wall. It was a little awkward, but if she added a grip up front, that would help stabilize it&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Claire?&#x201d;</p><p>Myrnin&#x2019;s voice came from <i>right behind her</i>, way too close. She whirled, and her finger accidentally hit the switch on top as she fumbled her hold on the machine, and suddenly there was a live trial in action . . . on him.</p><p>She saw it work.</p><p>Myrnin&#x2019;s eyes widened, turned very dark, and then began to shimmer with liquid hints of red. He took a step back from her. A large one. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. Please don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>She shut it off, fast, because she wasn&#x2019;t sure what exactly had just happened. <i>Something</i>, for sure, but as live trials went, it was . . . inconclusive. &#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; she said, and put the device down with a <i>clunk</i> on the marble top of the lab table. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to do that. Um . . . what did you feel?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More of what I already felt,&#x201d; he said, which was uninformative. He took another step backward, and the red didn&#x2019;t seem to be fading from his eyes. &#x201c;I was going to ask you if you&#x2019;d send over some type AB from the blood bank; I seem to be running low. And also, I wanted to ask if you&#x2019;d seen my bag of gummi worms.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hungry,&#x201d; Claire guessed. He nodded cautiously. &#x201c;And it . . . made it <i>stronger</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a way,&#x201d; he said. Not helpful. &#x201c;Never mind the delivery from the blood bank. I believe I shall . . . take a walk. Good night, Claire.&#x201d;</p><p>He was being awfully polite, she thought; with him, that was usually a cover for severe internal issues. Before she could try to figure out exactly what was going on in his head, though, he&#x2019;d headed at vampire-speed for the stairs and was gone.</p><p>She shook her head and looked at the switched-off device in irritation. &#x201c;Well, that was helpful,&#x201d; she told it, and then rolled her eyes. &#x201c;And now I&#x2019;m talking to equipment, like him. Great.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire threw a sheet over the machine, made notes in the logbook, turned off the lab&#x2019;s lights, and headed home.</p><p>Arriving home&#x2014;on Lot Street&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t do much for her mood, either, because as she stomped past the rusty, leaning mailbox on the outside of the picket fence, she saw that the door was open and mail was sticking out. It threatened to blow away in the ever-present desert wind. Perfect. She had three housemates, and all of them had somehow failed to pick up the mail. And that was not her job. At least today.</p><p>She glared up at the big, faded Victorian house, and wondered when Shane was going to get around to painting it as he&#x2019;d promised he would. Never, most likely. Just like the mail.</p><p>Claire readjusted her heavy backpack on one shoulder, an automatic, thoughtless shift of weight, snatched the wadded-up paper out of the box, and flipped through the thick handfuls. Water bill (apparently, saving the town from water-dwelling draug monsters hadn&#x2019;t given them any utility credits), electric bill (high, again), flyers from the new pizza delivery place (whose pizza tasted like dog food on tomato sauce), and . . . four envelopes, embossed with the Founder&#x2019;s official seal.</p><p>She headed for the house. And then the day took one step further to the dark side, because pinned to the front door with a cheap pot-metal dagger was a hand-drawn note with four tombstones on it. Each headstone had one of their names. And below, it said, <i>Vampire lovers get what they deserve</i>.</p><p>Charming. It would have scared her except that it wasn&#x2019;t the first she&#x2019;d seen over the past few weeks; there had been four other notes, one slipped under the door, two pinned on it (like this one), and one slipped into the mailbox. That, and a steady and growing number of rude storeke...</p></p><h2>The Scale of Things: Mind-blowing Proportions, Remarkable Ratios and Extraordinary Facts</h2><p>If the Sun is the size of a Grapefruit, the Earth is a grain of sand, then the distance between the two is a London bus.

It turned out that the job was for the Internal Revenue Service - the most hated and feared organization in the federal government.</p> <p>So Yancey became the man who got in his car, drove to your house, knocked on your door, and made you pay. Never mind that his car was littered with candy wrappers, his palms were sweaty, and he couldn�t remember where he stashed his own tax records. He was there on the authority of the United States government.</p> <p>With "a rich mix of humor, horror, and angst [and] better than most novels on the bestseller lists" (<em>Boston Sunday Globe</em>), <em>Confessions of a Tax Collector</em> contains an astonishing cast of too-strange-for-fiction characters. But the most intriguing character of all is Yancey himself who - in detailing how the job changed him and how he managed to pull himself back from the brink of moral, ethical, and spiritual bankruptcy - reveals what really lies beneath those dark suits and mirrored sunglasses.</p>This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</p><p>Imagine if Brad Meltzer or John Grisham's first book had been a memoir about working for the Internal Revenue Service and you have an idea of just how thrilling Richard Yancey's <i>Confessions of a Tax Collector: One Man's Tour of Duty Inside the IRS</i> really is. Serving as a revenue agent--or, more informally, a tax collector--of the IRS for two years, Yancey went through strange transformations--from a tall, pencil-thin theater major, in an unforgiving relationship with no steady income, to a mean, muscle-wielding, unyielding revenue officer at the top of his game. What happens in between this tax collecting, money-hungry metamorphosis makes this memorable memoir the stuff of great fiction. <p> The Americans who shirk tax laws and responsibilities are inevitably tracked, coded, analyzed, pursued, and in general, marked for tax collection by a legion of government workers take center stage. "We have superior intelligence; we know more about our enemies' lives than they know about themselves. We know where they are. We know what they do. We know what they have. We will execute what they fear," Yancey writes. Just envision the line-up of misfits and average joes who populate the screen on <i>Cops</i> or <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i> and you'll be close to imagining the range of people Yancey tangles with. Vengeful middle managers, hard-working small business owners, mean-spirited tax protestors, hardened tax evaders--the list of characters goes on and on. Every one of the people tracked within the walls of Yancey's local IRS office has the same, pitiful problem: the tax man cometh and the "beast needs to be fed." Equal parts love story, business tale, high-speed chase, and self-evolution, Yancey's <i>Confessions of a Tax Collector</i> packs plenty of human drama--all of it experienced and survived by one man. <i>--E. Brooke Gilbert</i></p><p>Richard Yancey worked for twelve years as a revenue officer for the Internal Revenue Service. He is a produced playwright, a former theater critic, and a published novelist.</p></p><h2>Breakout at Stalingrad</h2><p><p>Stalingrad, November 1942. Lieutenant Breuer dreams of returning home for Christmas. Since August, the Germans have been fighting the Soviets for control of the city on the Volga. Between November 19 and 23&nbsp;a Soviet counterattack encircles the Sixth Army. Some 300,000 German troops will endure a hellish winter on the freezing steppe. When Field Marshal Paulus surrenders on February 2, 1943, just 91,000 German soldiers remain alive. Breakout at Stalingrad has an extraordinary story behind it. Its author was imprisoned by the Soviets at Stalingrad. In captivity, he wrote a novel based on his experiences, which the Soviets confiscated.

The answer, argued Freud in this groundbreaking study of humor, is that jokes, like dreams, satisfy our unconscious desires. <i>The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious</i>&nbsp;explains how jokes provide immense pleasure by releasing us from our inhibitions and allowing us to express sexual, aggressive, playful, or cynical instincts that would otherwise remain hidden. In elaborating this theory, Freud brings together a rich collection of puns, witticisms, one-liners, and anecdotes, which, as Freud shows, are a method of giving ourselves away.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died the following year.&nbsp;Freud's career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation: psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half-century.<br><br><b>Joyce Crick</b> was for many years a senior lecturer in German at University College London.

In 1971, at age twenty-five, Galdikas left the placid world of American academia for the remote jungles of Indonesian Borneo. Living with her husband in a primitive camp, she became surrogate mother to a &#34;family&#34; of ex-captive orangutans - and gradually adjusted to the blood-sucking leeches, swarms of carnivorous insects, and constant humidity that rotted her belongings in the first year. Her first son spent the early years of his life at Camp Leakey with adopted orangutans as his only playmates. The wild orangutans Galdikas studied and the ex-captives she rehabilitated became an extended family of characters no less vivid than her human companions. Throatpouch, a huge and irritable grouch, fought off rivals for the right to claim adolescent Priscilla as his mate. Handsome Cara at first tried to rid the forest of its human intruder by hurling dead branches at Galdikas from the canopy above. Little Sugito, rescued from a cramped cage and returned to the jungle claimed Galdikas as his mother and clung to her fiercely, night and day, for months. A groundbreaking chronicler of the orangutans&#39; life cycle, Galdikas also describes the threats that increasingly menace them: the battles with poachers and loggers, the illicit trade in infant orangutans, the frustrations of official bureaucracy. Her story is a rare combination of personal epiphany, crucial scientific discovery, and international impact - a life of human and environmental challenge. Reflections of Eden is the third act of a drama that has captivated the world: the story of a pioneering primatologist, a world leader in conservation, and a remarkable woman.</p><p>Galdikas is a "trimate," one of three women who devoted themselves to the study of great apes in the wild. Her zeal for learning about orangutans emulates Jane Goodall's fascination with chimpanzees and the late Dian Fossey's dedication to gorillas. Not only is Galdikas a brilliant, courageous, and persevering scientist, but she is also a wonderfully engaging and generous writer. She tells the entire mesmerizing story of how she came to be the world's foremost orangutan expert, eloquently sharing her passion for these red-haired, arboreal, intelligent, gentle and reclusive yet personable creatures. As she recounts her exhausting efforts to track and observe the orangutans of Borneo's rain forest, Galdikas also candidly describes the unexpected impact her mission has on her personal life. Some of the most challenging and humbling episodes involve her serving as a surrogate mother for orphaned orangutan infants. As she gazes into the eyes of her beloved "cross-species" children, she catches a "glimpse of what we were before we were fully human. . .a reflection of Eden," a revelation that inspires much musing on the significance of our close genetic bond to our primate cousins. Galdikas' detailed chronicle is alive with captivating portraits of individual orangutans--from "vigorous and decisive" Cara to clinging Sugito, amorous TP, and loving Akmad--and charged with the forces of love, determination, grief, and recovery. <i>Donna Seaman</i>Until now, fans of primatologist Galdikas had to make do with brief accounts of her life and work in books such as Evelyn Gallardo's Among the Orangutans (Chronicle, 1993) and Sy Montgomery's Walking with the Great Apes (LJ 2/1/91). Galdikas, along with Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, was recruited by Louis Leaky to conduct long-term field studies of the great apes, in her case orangutans. While not as famous (or notorious) as her colleagues, Galdikas has been a phenomenal success in both her scientific studies and the conservation of orangutans. She also became immersed in Indonesian culture, marrying and raising children with a native Bornean. This book is a wonderful account of both her scientific work and personal experiences with a harsh environment, the loss of beloved orangutans, and the end of her first marriage to Canadian Rod Brindamour. Her humanity, courage, and dedication shine on every page. Highly recommended for all libraries, this book will inspire young scientists and enthrall anyone interested in orangutans and the rigors of modern field research.<br><i>--Beth Clewis, Prince William P.L., Va.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Homeowner's Complete Tree &amp; Shrub Handbook: The Essential Guide to Choosing, Planting, and Maintaining Perfect Landscape Plants</h2><p>Trees and shrubs can bring regal silhouettes, delightful shade, and spectacular foliage to any home landscape.

Our public discourse is polarized and hateful. Ethnic minorities face systemic injustices and the ever-present fear of violence and deportation. Economic inequalities are widening. In this book, Jake Meador diagnoses our society's decline as the failure of a particular story we've told about ourselves: the story of modern liberalism. He shows us how that story has led to our collective loss of meaning, wonder, and good work, and then recovers each of these by grounding them in a different story&#x2015;a story rooted in the deep tradition of the Christian faith. Our story doesn't have to end in loneliness and despair. There are reasons for hope&#x2015;reasons grounded in a different, better story. <em>In Search of the Common Good</em> reclaims a vision of common life for our fractured times: a vision that doesn't depend on the destinies of our economies or our political institutions, but on our citizenship in a heavenly city. Only through that vision&#x2015;and that citizenship&#x2015;can we truly work together for the common good.</p><p>Jake Meador is vice president of the Davenant Institute and the editor in chief of <em>Mere Orthodoxy</em>, an online magazine covering the Christian faith in the public sphere. He lives with his wife and children in his hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska."There are voices today that seem either to rub our noses in the church's failures or to revel in the culture's fragmentation. While <em>In Search of the Common Good</em> does confront us with the considerable ills of our time, it does so without giving up on either the church or the culture. Instead, it calls us back toward a vision of the 'good life'&#x2015;a vision both abandoned by those who have given up on Christian faith and obscured by the harrowed activism of others striving to do influential things in prominent ways in order to demonstrate Christianity's continued cultural viability. Indebted to his own deep Nebraskan roots (and to thoughtful others far beyond his local community), Meador has written a clear, compelling, and distinctly Christian volume focused on restoring communal flourishing. Born of the belief that Christianity is good news for a world beset by evil and for a church struggling with compromise, so we are encouraged to make our difference by taking up a humbler set of Christian disciplines and practicing ordinary piety. Should Wendell Berry, Charles Taylor, and Francis Schaeffer ever have met to discuss the need for the church to lead by loving Jesus in daily neighbor-benefitting fashion, and should that conversation ever have been recorded, then I can imagine it looking and sounding rather like Jake Meador's <em>In Search of the Common Good</em>. A bracing, prayer-inducing yet hope-filled read, I am only glad to have read this volume and pray that it finds a wider audience that will take it to heart." (Mark P. Ryan, director of the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute, adjunct professor of religion and culture, Covenant Theological Seminary, St. Louis)<br><br>"Christian cultural commentators find themselves caught between the Scylla of despair and the Charybdis of triumphalism. It takes a wise, experienced navigator to sail between the two temptations. Meador's book somehow manages to pair a trenchant diagnosis of our polarized communities with a hopeful prognosis built on a deep theological conception of the good life. It challenges but does not provoke. It offers hope without presumption. Few will agree with Meador on every practical or theological point, but this is exactly why this book deserves to find a wide readership." (David Henreckson, assistant professor of theology, Dordt College)<br><br>"Like everything else Jake Meador writes, his call to reflect on our pursuit of the common good is a thought-provoking, worthwhile read. It's also a timely one, if only because it seems so easy to spot our common ills. A distorted notion of freedom in America has given birth to the slavery of self and all its attendant pathologies: loneliness, existential anomie, and pointless work, which form the inner reality of economic instability and sociopolitical isolation. Unfortunately, a malformed, superficial, and ill-catechized church reflects the world at just this point. What, then, may we hope for our common life? Drawing on the wisdom of Scripture, natural law, and the practices of the Christian tradition, Jake points us to a vision of work, community, and politics attuned to the rhythms of creation, reflective of the eternal city and ultimately rooted in the goodness of God himself. I was challenged by this book and I know I'll be wrestling with and reflecting on its argument for some time. I suspect I won't be the only one." (Derek Rishmawy, PhD student at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, columnist at Christianity Today, cohost of Mere Fidelity podcast)<br><br>"I've long admired the breadth of knowledge on display in Jake Meador's writing. You'll see his characteristic combination of deep learning with an earthy touch in this wide-ranging book. You won't need to agree with every conclusion in order to appreciate how he makes you think and act more deliberately. We need more writers like him to help us live as faithful Christians in a fractured world." (Collin Hansen, editorial director for The Gospel Coalition, coauthor of A God-Sized Vision)<br><br>"Jake's book accurately diagnoses some of the ills of our modern world and, even more importantly, provides a vivid, specific vision of a full and flourishing Christian life." (Leah Libresco, author of Building the Benedict Option and Arriving at Amen)<br><br>"Jake Meador is one of the most insightful evangelical writers of his generation. Without downplaying the severity of the crises that are currently crippling both our churches and our country, he nevertheless sketches what a quietly hopeful Christian witness in our troubled times might look like. By turns diagnostic, instructive, expository, and artful and with a disarming lack of cynicism throughout, this moving book channels Wendell Berry in arguing for the renewable dignity of disappearing virtues." (Wesley Hill, associate professor of biblical studies, Trinity School for Ministry, Ambridge, Pennsylvania)<br><br>"What if the malaise that grips American communities is the fruit of a church that has failed to bear faithful witness to her King? Jake Meador's convicting yet hope-giving book calls the church to take up the practice of distinctively Christian forms of membership in order to serve the common good. Meador reminds us that when Christians pursue hidden fidelity rather than public praise, sacrificial service rather than personal peace and affluence, and patient catechesis rather than flashy policy proposals, it is then that they will bless their neighbors." (Jeffrey Bilbro, author of Virtues of Renewal: Wendell Berry's Sustainable Forms, editor in chief at Front Porch Republic)<br><br>"If the bonds of modern society show signs of strain, it is in part because the goods we share as members have ceased to be common or perceived as good. Yet, as Jake Meador reminds us in <em>In Search of the Common Good</em>, the love that unites us around the goods we share in common is reaffirmed through our practices of community and renewed by the promise of community. Meador has provided here an important recovery of the deeply <em>Christian</em> notion of the common good, offering a knowledgeable diagnosis of the common good's fall into disfavor and an equally knowledgeable proposal for recovering it. Meador reminds us that the common good is <em>worth</em> searching for, and in searching <em>for</em> it we share <em>in</em> it together, eager for all to receive the gifts God has given. Read this book&#x2015;for you and for your community." (Matthew Arbo, assistant professor of theological studies, director of the Center for Faith and Public Life)<br><br>"<em>In Search of the Common Good</em> is not just a good book, it is a necessary book for our time. Jake diagnoses many of the deep problems in our society and offers a distinctly Christian path forward. I have already begun recommending the book widely, and I suspect that the church in America will be reading and discussing it for a long time to come." (Alan Noble, author of Disruptive Witness)<br><br>"In this beautiful and compelling book, Meador offers readers more than a list of our societal ills. He offers us hope&#x2015;and a clear and steady path to restoring our homes, churches, and communities. For those already on that path, <em>In Search of the Common Good</em> will breathe new life into their efforts, encouraging them that their lives of quiet faithfulness and goodness are far more significant than they realize. And for those still finding their way, Meador's words beckon us to the path of life."

And read in that light, this newest collection of his work is very serious indeed. It is an abundant offering of his signature mocking humor, subverting received conventions and pretensions in both poetry and everyday life, public and private, ingeniously and wittily rendered into English in an antitranslation (the word is Parra's) by Liz Werner. Of the fifty-eight pieces in <em>Antipoems</em>, the first twenty-three are taken from Parra's 1985 collection, <em>Hojas de Parra</em> ("Vine Leaves" or "Leaves of Parra"), two others appeared in his <em>Paginas en Blanco</em> ("Blank Pages," 2001), while the rest come straight out of his notebooks and have never been published before, either in Spanish or English. The book itself is divided into two sections, "Antipoems" (im)proper and a selection of Parra's most recent incarnation of the antipoem, the hand-drawn images of his "Visual Artefactos."<br><br> As his anti-translator Liz Werner explains in her Introduction, Parra's scientific training infuses his work.

He mustn&#x2019;t rush this&#x2014;this was something to be savored and enjoyed. The anticipation was sometimes more enjoyable than the act&#x2014;experience had taught him that. He must linger over this one. In the days ahead, he would want to replay these memories as accurately as he could.</p><p>She was framed by a row of abandoned houses. Nobody wanted to live round here anymore and these homes were now hollow and dirty. They were crack dens and flophouses, strewn with dirty needles and dirtier mattresses. As he crossed the street toward her, the girl looked up, peering through her thick fringe. Hauling herself off the wall, she said nothing, simply nodding toward the nearest shell of a house before stepping inside. There was no negotiation, no preamble. It was as if she was resigned to her fate. As if she knew.</p><p>Hurrying to catch up with her, the man drank in her backside, her legs, her heels, his arousal growing all the time. As she disappeared into the darkness, he picked up the pace. He couldn&#x2019;t wait any longer.</p><p>The floorboards creaked noisily as he stepped inside. The derelict house was just how he had pictured it in his fantasies. An overpowering smell of damp filled his nostrils&#x2014;everything was rotten here. He hurried into the sitting room, now a repository for abandoned G-strings and condoms. No sign of her. So they were going to play &#x201c;Chase me,&#x201d; were they?</p><p>Into the kitchen. No sign. Turning, he stalked out and climbed the stairs to the second floor. With each step, his eyes darted this way and that, searching for his prey.</p><p>He marched into the front bedroom. A mildewed bed, a broken window, a dead pigeon. But no sign of the girl.</p><p>Fury now wrestled with his desire. Who was she to mess with him like this? She was a common whore. Dog shit on his shoe. He was going to make her suffer for treating him like this.</p><p>He pushed the bathroom door open&#x2014;nothing&#x2014;then turned and marched into the second bedroom. He would smash her stupid fa&#x2014;</p><p>Suddenly his head snapped back. Pain raged through him&#x2014;they were pulling his hair so tight, dragging him back, back, back. Now he couldn&#x2019;t breathe&#x2014;a rag was being forced over his mouth and nose. A sharp, biting odor flared up his nostrils and, too late, instinct kicked in. He struggled for his life, but already he was losing consciousness. Then everything went black.</p><br><p><b>2</b></p><p>They were watching her every move. Hanging on her every word.</p><p>&#x201c;The body is that of a white female, aged between twenty and twenty-five. She was found by a Community Support officer yesterday morning in the boot of an abandoned car on the Greenwood estate.&#x201d;</p><p>Detective Inspector Helen Grace&#x2019;s voice was clear and strong, despite the tension that knotted her stomach. She was briefing the Major Incident Team on the seventh floor of Southampton Central Police Station.</p><p>&#x201c;As you can see from the pictures, her teeth were caved in, probably with a hammer, and both her hands have been cut off. She is heavily tattooed, which might help with IDing, and you should concentrate your efforts on drugs and prostitution to begin with. This looks like a gang-related killing rather than a common or garden-variety murder. DS Bridges is going to lead on this one and he&#x2019;ll fill you in on particular persons of interest. Tony?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am. First things first: I want to check precedents . . .&#x201d;</p><p>As DS Bridges hit his stride, Helen slipped away. Even after all this time, she couldn&#x2019;t bear being the center of everyone&#x2019;s attention, gossip and intrigue. It had been nearly a year since she&#x2019;d brought Marianne&#x2019;s terrible killing spree to an end, but the interest in Helen was as strong as ever. Bringing in a serial killer was impressive enough; shooting your own sister to do so was something else. In the immediate aftermath, friends, colleagues, journalists and strangers had rushed to offer sympathy and support. But it was all largely fake&#x2014;what they wanted were details. They wanted to open Helen up and pick over her insides&#x2014;what was it like to shoot your sister? Were you abused by your father? Do you feel guilty for all those deaths? Do you feel responsible?</p><p>Helen had spent her entire adult life building a high wall around herself&#x2014;even the name Helen Grace was a fiction&#x2014;but thanks to Marianne that wall had been destroyed forever. Initially Helen had been tempted to run&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been offered leave, a transfer, even a retirement package&#x2014;but somehow she had caught hold of herself, returning to work at Southampton Central as soon as they would allow her to do so. She knew that wherever she went the eyes of the world would be on her. Better to face the examination on home turf, where for many years life had been good to her.</p><p>That was the theory, but it had proved far from easy. There were so many memories here&#x2014;of Mark, of Charlie&#x2014;and so many people who were willing to probe, speculate or even joke about her ordeal. Even now, months after she&#x2019;d returned to work, there were times when she just had to get away.</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>Helen snapped to, oblivious to the desk sergeant she was walking straight past.</p><p>&#x201c;Good night, Harry. Hope the Saints remember how to win for you tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Her tone was bright, but the words sounded strange, as if the effort of being perky was too much for her. Hurrying outside, she picked up her Kawasaki and, opening the throttle, sped away down West Quay Road. The sea fog that had rolled in earlier clung to the city and Helen vanished inside it.</p><p>Keeping her speed strong but steady, she glided past the traffic crawling its way to St. Mary&#x2019;s Stadium. Reaching the outskirts of town, she diverted onto the motorway. Force of habit made her check her mirrors, but there was no one following her. As the traffic eased, she raised her speed. Hitting eighty miles per hour, she paused for a second before pushing it to ninety. She never felt so at ease as when she was traveling at speed.</p><p>The towns flicked by. Winchester, then Farnborough, before eventually Aldershot loomed into view. Another quick check of the mirrors, then into the city center. Parking her bike, Helen sidestepped a group of drunken squaddies and hurried off, hugging the shadows as she went. Nobody knew her here, but even so she couldn&#x2019;t take any chances.</p><p>She walked past the train station and before long she was in Cole Avenue, in the heart of Aldershot&#x2019;s suburbia. She wasn&#x2019;t sure she was doing the right thing, yet she&#x2019;d felt compelled to return. Settling herself down amid the undergrowth that flanked one side of the street, she took up her usual vantage point.</p><p>Time crawled by. Helen&#x2019;s stomach growled and she realized that she hadn&#x2019;t eaten since breakfast. Stupid really&#x2014;she was getting thinner by the day. What was she trying to prove to herself? There were better ways of atoning than by starving yourself to death.</p><p>Suddenly there was movement. A shouted &#x201c;bye&#x201d; and then the door of number 14 slammed shut. Helen crouched lower. Her eyes remained glued to the young man who was now hurrying down the street, tapping numbers into his mobile phone. He passed within ten feet of Helen, never once detecting her presence, before disappearing round the corner. Helen counted to fifteen, then left her hiding place and set off in pursuit.</p><p>The man&#x2014;a boyish twenty-five-year-old&#x2014;was handsome, with thick dark hair and a full face. Casually dressed, with his jeans hanging around his bum, he looked like so many young men, desperate to appear cool and uninterested. It made Helen smile a little at the studied casualness of it all.</p><p>A knot of rowdy lads loomed into view, stationed outside the Railway Tavern. Two pounds a pint, fifty pence a shot and free pool, it was a mecca for the young, the skint and the shady. The elderly owner was happy to serve anyone who&#x2019;d hit puberty, so it was always packed, the crowds spilling out onto the street. Helen was glad of the cover, slipping in among the bodies to observe undetected. The gaggle of lads greeted the young man with a cheer as he waved a twenty-pound note at them. They entered and Helen followed. Waiting patiently in the queue for the bar, she was invisible to them&#x2014;anyone over the age of thirty didn&#x2019;t exist in their world.</p><p>After a couple of drinks, the gang drifted away from the prying eyes of the pub toward a kids&#x2019; playground on the outskirts of town. The tatty urban park was deserted and Helen had to tail the boys cautiously. Any woman wandering alone at night through a park is likely to draw attention to herself, so she hung back. She found an aged oak tree, grievously wounded with scores of lovers&#x2019; carvings, and stationed herself in its shadow. From here, she could watch unmolested, as the gang smoked dope, happy and carefree in spite of the cold.</p><p>Helen had spent her whole life being watched, but here she was invisible. In the aftermath of Marianne&#x2019;s death, her life had been picked apart, opened up for public consumption. As a result people thought they knew her inside and out.</p><p>But there was one thing they didn&#x2019;t know. One secret that she had kept to herself.</p><p>And he was standing not fifty feet away from her now, utterly oblivious to her presence.</p><br><br><p><b>3</b></p><p>His eyes blinked open, but he couldn&#x2019;t see.</p><p>Liquid oozed down his cheeks, as his eyeballs swiveled uselessly in their sockets. Sound was horribly muted, as if his ears were stuffed with cotton wool. Scrambling back to consciousness, the man felt a savage pain ripping through his throat and nostrils. An intense burning sensation, like a flame held steadily to his larynx. He wanted to sneeze, to retch, to spit out whatever it was that was tormenting him. But he was gagged, his mouth bound tightly with duct tape, so he had to swallow down his agony.</p><p>Eventually the stream of tears abated and his protesting eyes began to take in their surroundings. He was still in the derelict house, only now he was in the front bedroom, lying prostrate on the filthy bed. His nerves were jangling and he struggled wildly&#x2014;he had to get away&#x2014;but his arms and legs were bound tight to the iron bedstead. He yanked, pulled and twisted, but the nylon cords held firm.</p><p>Only now did he realize he was naked. A terrible thought pulsed through him&#x2014;were they going to leave him here like this? To freeze to death? His skin had already raised its defenses&#x2014;goose bumps erect with cold and terror&#x2014;and he realized how perishingly cold it was.</p><p>He bellowed for all he was worth&#x2014;but all he produced was a dull, buzzing moan. If he could just talk to them, reason with them . . . he could get them more money, and they would let him go. They couldn&#x2019;t leave him here like this. Humiliation seeped into his fear now, as he looked down at his bloated, middle-aged body stretched out on the stained eiderdown.</p><p>He strained to hear, hoping against hope that he was not alone. But there was nothing. They had abandoned him. How long would they leave him here? Until they had emptied all his accounts? Until they had got away? The man shuddered, already dreading the prospect of bargaining for his liberty with some junkie or whore. What would he do when he was liberated? What would he say to his family? To the police? He cursed himself bitterly for being so bloody stup&#x2014;</p><p>A creaking floorboard. So he wasn&#x2019;t alone. Hope flared through him&#x2014;perhaps now he could find out what they wanted. He craned round to try and engage his attacker, but they were approaching from behind and remained out of view. It suddenly struck him that the bed he was tied to had been pushed out into the middle of the room, as if center stage at a show. No one could possibly want to sleep with it like that, so why . . . ?</p><p>A falling shadow. Before he could react, something was passing over his eyes, his nose, his mouth. Some sort of hood. He could feel the soft fabric on his face, the drawstring being pulled taut. Already he was struggling to breathe, the thick velvet resting over his protesting nostrils. He shook his head furiously this way and that, fighting to create some tiny pocket of breathing space. Any moment he expected the string to be pulled still tighter, but to his surprise nothing happened.</p><p>What now? All was silent again, apart from the his labored breathing. It was getting hot inside the hood. Could oxygen get in here? He forced himself to breathe slowly. If he panicked now, he would hyperventilate and then . . .</p><p>Suddenly he flinched, his nerves pulsing wildly. Something cold had come to rest on his thigh. Something hard. Something metal? A knife? Now it was drifting up his leg, toward . . . The man bucked furiously, tearing his muscles as he wrenched at the cords that held him. He knew now that this was a fight to the death.</p><p>He shrieked for all he was worth. But the tape held firm. His bonds wouldn&#x2019;t yield. And there was no one to hear his screams.</p><br><p><b>4</b></p><p>&#x201c;Business or pleasure?&#x201d;</p><p>Helen spun round, her heart thumping. Climbing the darkened stairwell to her flat, she had assumed she was alone. Irritation at being surprised mingled with a brief burst of anxiety . . . but it was only James, framed in the doorway of his flat. He had moved into the flat below her three months ago, and being a senior nurse at South Hants Hospital, he kept unsociable hours.</p><p>&#x201c;Business,&#x201d; Helen lied. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Business that I thought was going to become pleasure. But . . . she just left in a cab.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pity.&#x201d;</p><p>James shrugged and smiled his crooked smile. He was late thirties, handsome in his scruffy way, with a lazy charm that usually worked on junior nurses.</p><p>&#x201c;No accounting for taste,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;I thought she liked me, but I&#x2019;ve always been crap at reading signals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; Helen responded, not believing a word.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, do you fancy company? I&#x2019;ve got a bottle of wine that&#x2019;s . . . tea, I&#x2019;ve got tea . . . ,&#x201d; he said, correcting himself.</p><p>Up until that point Helen could have been tempted.

In the words of Harvard Law Professor, Laurence H. Tribe--"<i>Ultimate Punishment</i> is the ultimate statement about the death penalty: to read it is to understand why law alone cannot make us whole."</p><p>As a respected criminal lawyer, Scott Turow has been involved with the death penalty for more than a decade, including successfully representing two different men convicted in death-penalty prosecutions. In this vivid account of how his views on the death penalty have evolved, Turow describes his own experiences with capital punishment from his days as an impassioned young prosecutor to his recent service on the Illinois commission which investigated the administration of the death penalty and influenced Governor George Ryan's unprecedented commutation of the sentences of 164 death row inmates on his last day in office. Telling the powerful stories behind the statistics, as he moves from the Governor's Mansion to Illinois's state-of-the art "super-max" prison and the execution chamber, <i>Ultimate Punishment</i> has all the drama and intellectual substance of Turow's bestselling fiction.</p></p><p><b>Scott Turow</b> is the world-famous author of six bestselling novels about the law, from<i> Presumed Innocent</i> (1987) to<i> Reversible Errors</i> (2002), which centers on a death. He lives with his family outside Chicago where he is a partner in the firm of Sonnenschein, Nath &amp; Rosenthal.In 1999, Governor George Ryan of Illinois asked the author, a lawyer turned novelist, to sit on a commission to study the death penalty. Turow's storytelling ability transforms what he learned during that inquiry into a thought-provoking treatise based upon his experience in capital cases, personal interviews, extensive reading, and the proceedings he attended. His measured, deliberate voice makes sure every word receives the right emphasis, as though he were speaking to a jury. Neither his delivery nor his rhetoric proselytizes, and listeners will never be sure on what side of the polemic he stands, until the last word of the audiobook reveals his verdict.

Down there, on a crystal blue day in September, the sun shining hot and bright until it starts to go down, you might feel a slight note of coolness in the air, a note that makes you think of football and back-to-school and leaves turning and all those other bittersweet signs that the season is changing. Something so subtle you might even be forgiven for missing it the first time it happened. Especially if you didn&#x2019;t want the summer to end. <br>Up here, on the shores of Lake Superior, there&#x2019;s a cold wind that gathers from the north and picks up weight as it builds its way across two hundred miles of open water, and then, on a late afternoon in August&#x2014;hell, sometimes in July&#x2014;that wind hits you square in the face and makes its intention quite clear, no matter how much you might not like the message. Summer may not be one hundred percent done, not just yet, but it&#x2019;s been mortally gutshot, and it&#x2019;s only a matter of days until it&#x2019;s gone. <br>It was late August this time around. Actual <i>late</i> August, meaning an absurdly long summer. I&#x2019;ve got six cabins stretched along an old logging road, built by my father, and in the summer I rent them out to a particular brand of tourist who wants to get away from everything without actually going to Canada or Alaska. They&#x2019;re mostly repeat customers, because there&#x2019;s something about this place. While they&#x2019;re here, they might go around the corner to Tahquamenon Falls, or all the way up to the Shipwreck Museum on Whitefish Point, stand there and look out at the vast expanse of water, maybe think about the <i>Edmund Fitzgerald</i> resting just a few miles out there, five hundred feet below the surface. Come back and spend some time at the Glasgow Inn. That&#x2019;s summer in Paradise. <br>I was at that very same Glasgow Inn that night. I was sitting at the bar, instead of my usual place in front of the fire, having given up my chair and the chair opposite to a couple from Wyandotte. They were staying in one of my cabins, and when they asked me where they should go to eat, I directed them here for Jackie&#x2019;s famous beef stew. After that and a couple of cocktails, they looked to be quite content, just sitting by the fire and looking at each other. <br>As for me, well&nbsp;&#x2026; There was nobody for me to look at. I had just felt the northern wind and had come in to inform Jackie that summer was on its last legs, something he never enjoyed hearing. Which might be why I always made a point of being the one to tell him. We have that kind of relationship, I guess. I bother him on a nightly basis, and in return he complains to me about everything in the world, including my own presence in his bar. <br>Oh, and once a week, he drives across the Internationl Bridge to bring me back a case of real Canadian Molson. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can take another winter,&#x201d; he said to me, as he banged down one of those Molsons on the bar top. <br>&#x201c;You say that every year.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This time, I mean it.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been here in Paradise, Michigan going on thirty years now, and yet he still had that Scottish accent. He&#x2019;d tell you that he&#x2019;d lost it, of course, that he sounded just as American as I did. Just one more thing he was wrong about. <br>There was a television above the bar. The sound was off, but I was watching the Tigers play the Rangers. It was a home game, in what I still thought of as their brand-new ballpark, even though it had been a few years now. Comerica Park, one of those new-style parks that opened up into the city, showing off all of the downtown buildings I had once known so well. Three hundred miles from where I was sitting, and what felt like a thousand years ago. <br>&#x201c;I hear Arizona&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; Jackie said. &#x201c;I hear it&#x2019;s <i>real</i> nice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They have rattlesnakes there,&#x201d; I said, not taking my eyes off the television. &#x201c;And scorpions.&#x201d; <br>Jackie scoffed at that, but I could tell the idea had gotten to him. There weren&#x2019;t any rattlesnakes or scorpions crawling around when he was growing up in Glasgow, and as for Paradise&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, they might have a few eastern massasauga rattlesnakes downstate, but you&#x2019;d probably never find one in your bed up here. <br>&#x201c;Summer&#x2019;s supposed to last more than a goddamned month,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the part I just don&#x2019;t know if I can live with anymore.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think we had double that this year. Besides, you <i>love</i> the winters up here.&#x201d; <br>He just stood there looking at me, bar towel in hand, like he was ready to smack me with it. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold as hell,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;it snows every day, and it lasts forever. What&#x2019;s not to like?&#x201d; <br>He shook his head, looking tired, like winter had already begun. <br>&#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You love winter because you know this becomes the best place on earth. This bar, right over there by that fireplace.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;With your sorry backside parked in front of it every night, ordering me around. You&#x2019;re right, it doesn&#x2019;t get any better.&#x201d; <br>He looked over at the couple by the fireplace. <br>&#x201c;How old do you think those two are, anyway?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hell if I know.&#x201d; I turned to give them a quick once-over. &#x201c;Forty, maybe?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Forty years old and they&#x2019;re sitting there looking at each other like they&#x2019;re on their honeymoon.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Second honeymoon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they told me. They wanted to go to the most out-of-the-way place they could find without having to fly.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Which cabin do you have them in?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The last one. Now that I finally have it finished.&#x201d; Meaning rebuilt and refurnished, after somebody burned it down for me. <br>&#x201c;End of the line,&#x201d; he said, nodding his approval. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be a soul bothering them there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sounding almost romantic, Jackie. Did you hit your head today?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Smartass.&#x201d; He turned away from me and started cleaning some glasses. This was the man who had survived the worst marriage in the history of mankind, to hear him tell it. Yet here he was, getting downright wistful at the sight of a man and a woman who were obviously married and didn&#x2019;t seem to hate each other. <br>Then it occurred to me. This was a bar in a town that saw its fair share of hunters in the fall, snowmobilers in the winter. Which means lots of men. Bird-watching had become the big thing in the spring lately, meaning mostly women. Then families in the summertime. A mom and a dad, yes, but also a couple of kids along to complain about how their cell phones don&#x2019;t work up here. The one sight you <i>don&#x2019;t</i> see too often in Paradise, Michigan is a moony-eyed couple, whether on their first honeymoon or their second. <br>The man caught my eye and raised his glass to me. I raised my bottle of Molson in return. <br>I&#x2019;d been married myself once. A long time ago, to a woman I met when I went to college after baseball. A woman I didn&#x2019;t have much in common with, aside from the &#x201c;Mc&#x201d; in our last names. Jeannie McDonald, who became Jeannie McKnight, who went back to being Jeannie McDonald again. Who may have then remarried and changed her name yet again. I&#x2019;m ashamed to say I don&#x2019;t even know if she did, or if she still lives in Michigan. If we had had children together, the story would be different, I&#x2019;m sure. Or if I ever paid a cent of alimony. At least that way I would have had an address to send checks to. As it was, she just left. Just walked away. I got the divorce papers in the mail, I signed them, I sent them back to her lawyer, and then we were done. <br>I wonder if she feels guilty. Wherever she is now, whoever she&#x2019;s with, I wonder if she looks back at the way she bailed out on me a few weeks after I got shot and has any regrets. <br>Hell, I wonder if I&#x2019;d even hold it against her now. I think I knew, way back when, that we&#x2019;d never last, shooting or no shooting. I think we both knew. <br>I sat there at the bar, looking at my bottle as the Tigers played in silence above my head. There&#x2019;d been a few women in that lost year after I left the force. Then I&#x2019;d come up to Paradise thinking I&#x2019;d sell off my father&#x2019;s cabins and had ended up staying here. Something about the place had spoken to me. Like this is where you really belong, mister. In the midst of these trees bending in the wind. On the shores of this cold lake. This stark lonely place on the edge of the world, which also turns into the most beautiful place on earth for the few days they call summer. <br>Then there was Sylvia, the wife of a rich man who thought I was his friend. Then Natalie, a cop from Ontario, someone who&#x2019;d lost her partner, just as I had. Someone who may or may not have turned out to be the right person for me, if I had ever gotten the chance to find out. <br>No. God damn it. No. <br>I put the bottle down. This is not where you want to be going tonight, I said to myself. This is not going to make you feel one little bit better about going back to that cabin alone. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with you?&#x201d; Jackie said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; <br>He narrowed his eyes at me like he wasn&#x2019;t buying it. Which made it feel like the right time to leave. A minute later I was outside in the cold night air, looking up at the stars and listening to the soft waves just behind the tree line. <br>I got in the truck and took the left turn down that old logging road, deep into the woods, passing my one neighbor&#x2019;s cabin. Vinnie Red Sky Leblanc, a blackjack dealer over at the Bay Mills Casino. He&#x2019;d gotten into some trouble, and I&#x2019;d been watching out for him. The lights were on at his place, and everything looked normal, so I gave him a honk and kept driving. My cabin was the first, the one I&#x2019;d helped my old man build back when I was eighteen years old and on my way to play Single-A ball. Back when I was young, stupid, and full of energy, and I didn&#x2019;t have a nine-millimeter slug sitting half a centimeter from my heart. <br>When I got inside, I saw the light flashing on the answering machine. I don&#x2019;t get a hell of a lot of calls. I hit the play button and listened to a voice from my distant past. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Alex McKnight! This is Tony Grimaldi. Remember me? I was a sergeant in the First Precinct, way the hell back when. I hope you&#x2019;re doing okay, and I hope you don&#x2019;t mind me calling you out of the blue. But I&#x2019;m really just making a courtesy call, and I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you could give me a call back.&#x201d; <br>He gave me his number. Then he signed off. <br>I stood there looking down at the machine, wondering why in God&#x2019;s name a desk sergeant from the old precinct would be calling me. I checked the time. I was in early, thanks to Jackie being an extra pain in the ass that night. So I figured what the hell, give the sergeant a call back. <br>I dialed the number, making note of the 734 area code. That was one of the new codes split off from the original 313. If you still had a 313, that meant you were either in Detroit or close enough to see it from your front door. <br>&#x201c;Alex, is that you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sergeant Grimaldi,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How have you been, sir?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can call me Tony now. I don&#x2019;t wear a badge anymore.&#x201d; <br>A half beat of silence then, as we skipped over my comeback. I wasn&#x2019;t wearing a badge anymore, either. I hadn&#x2019;t worn one in many years. <br>&#x201c;How long have you been out?&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over ten years now. Hard to imagine. But most days I don&#x2019;t miss it much, to tell you the truth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I hear ya.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing like it, of course. You know what I mean.&#x201d; <br>Another half beat. <br>&#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re absolutely right. But how did you ever think to get hold of me after all this time?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, like I said in the message, it&#x2019;s just a courtesy call. I play golf with a few of the actives, and one of them happened to mention you. He was going to call you himself, but I told him I&#x2019;d love to catch up with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay. Glad you did.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I said, but it still wasn&#x2019;t making any sense. <br>&#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;re still drawing the disability, so obviously they had all of your contact information.&#x201d; <br>Disability. Not exactly my favorite word in the world, but I guess that&#x2019;s what you had to call it officially. When an officer gets shot on the job, he&#x2019;s eligible for two-thirds of his salary for the rest of his life. I don&#x2019;t make a point of telling most people that, because they&#x2019;ll inevitably look at me and try to see how it is I&#x2019;m supposedly disabled now. I mean, I can&#x2019;t raise my right arm all the way anymore. I can&#x2019;t throw a ball, which would have been more of a big deal back when I was a catcher, I realize, but not so much now. If you really pressed me, I&#x2019;d just have to tell you that I took three bullets and only two came out, and I&#x2019;m supposed to go get periodic X-rays to make sure that third bullet isn&#x2019;t migrating closer to my heart, at which point it could kill me. <br>I&#x2019;m supposed to go get those X-rays every year, but I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m supposed to feel guilt or gratitude or a mixture of both every time I get one of those checks in the mail, but I don&#x2019;t feel that, either. Mostly I just try to forget it ever happened. <br>&#x201c;So what did you have to tell me, Sergeant? I&#x2019;ve never gotten a courtesy call before.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you, call me Tony, please. But here&#x2019;s the deal. You remember a case you worked on, that last year you were on the force, where you ended up putting away a guy named Darryl King?&#x201d; <br>I was confused for exactly one second, because I never made detective and so technically I never really worked on a &#x201c;case.&#x201d; But as soon as I connected the name to the crime, it all came back to me. You don&#x2019;t see a crime scene like that without remembering it for the rest of your life. <br>&#x201c;Darryl King,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;In the train station.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You forgot &#x2018;With the knife.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, bad joke. You know, like in that game? Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the lead pipe?&#x201d; <br>That&#x2019;s cop humor for you. A way to distance yourself from the most horrible crimes of all. A way to keep your sanity. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been away too long,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But seriously, why are we talking about Darryl King? Don&#x2019;t tell me he&#x2019;s getting out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He is. Believe it or not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That makes no sense. He drew a lot more time than that, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tell me about it. But remember how he was, what, sixteen years old?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember exactly, but that sounds about right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sixteen. Tried as an adult. It&#x2019;s been a real thing in the court lately, going back over those cases with youthful offenders.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like what, we were supposed to just send him home with a warning because he was a minor? Stop killing people or we&#x2019;ll take away your allowance?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m just the messenger here, Alex. You&#x2019;re preaching to the choir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, it&#x2019;s just&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know, I know. Believe me. I&#x2019;ve seen a few other cases like that. Maybe not as bad as this one. Bottom line, the kid&#x2019;s spent his whole adult life in prison. I don&#x2019;t know where he&#x2019;s going to live, what he&#x2019;s gonna do, but I do know he&#x2019;ll be out in a few days. Not that I expect him to come looking for you or anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, probably not. Good luck finding me, even if he wanted to.&#x201d; <br>The sergeant laughed at that. &#x201c;Yeah, what, you&#x2019;re where, in Paradise? I gotta be honest, I had to look up where that is before I called you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way from Detroit,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll have to watch my back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, like I said, I don&#x2019;t expect this kid to do anything. I keep calling him a kid, I realize, and he&#x2019;s not a kid now. But you know what I mean. You just need to let people know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I understand. So you called me&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And Detective Bateman, yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wow, Arnie Bateman,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Another name I haven&#x2019;t heard in a long time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, he&#x2019;s off the force now, too.

It traces the development of abstraction as it moved through a network of modern artists, from Marsden Hartley and Marcel Duchamp to Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich, sweeping across nations and across media. This richly illustrated publication covers a wide range of artistic production--including paintings, drawings, books, sculptures, film, photography, sound poetry, atonal music and non-narrative dance--to draw a cross-media portrait of these watershed years. An introductory essay by Leah Dickerman, Curator in the Museum&#x2019;s Department of Painting and Sculpture, is followed by focused studies of key groups of works, events and critical issues in abstraction&#x2019;s early history by renowned scholars from a variety of fields.</p><p>Featuring twenty-four contributors, this MoMA catalogue explores the evolution of early modernist abstraction across various mediums, countries and movements. (Arne Glimcher <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>Dickerman urges against defning abstraction in terms of forward progress... less interested in the invention of abstraction than abstraction as invention. The main impact of this horizontalist approach is geographic, bringing peripheral sites into focus without denying the importance of major hubs. (Daniel Marcus <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>Three quarters of a century after Alfred Barr, founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, mounted the landmark 1936 exhibition Cubism and Abtract Art, MoMA curator Dickerman returns to the realm with a vast exhibition and comprehensive catalogue depicting the incipient stages of abtraction in the plastic arts. Situating the movement from a representation toward abstraction as a synchronic historical moment, as well as one of modernism's principal activities, this Eurocentric organizational feat elaborates a network based on cross talk, spontaneity, and simultaneous development. The front endpapers of the catalogue offer a graphic spread that plays off Barr's legendary chart - the cover to his exhibition's catalogue - acanonical lineage of begotten isms. Dickerman's updated diagram turns reader's view to a distributed web of networks and memes in an endeavor that highlights connectivity over paternity. Even with his intended catholic aopproach, painting and the two - dimensional flattened spatial constructs of pictorial space overwhelmingly predominate. Music is accorded a seminal role; sculpture and film are underrepresented; typographic space and artists' books are thankfully recognized. A terrific collection of diverse short essays by nearly 30 scholars complement this intelligently edited, well- illustrated, and indispensable resource. (E.

But in fact the greatest consequence of that distant conflict was the birth of the U.S. Navy.

If you are interested in American history, the history of the United States Navy, or just plain real-life adventure stories, you owe it to yourself to read <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i>.<b>PRAISE FOR <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i></b><br><br>?At a time when America seems to flinch at threats from the world&#x2019;s petty tyrants, our forefathers&#x2019; defiance two centuries ago of the mightiest empire on earth should stiffen our spines. Ron Utt&#x2019;s inspiring narrative reminds us that this nation has never failed to produce heroes when they&#x2019;re needed most.&#x201d;<br>?<b>Edwin Feulner</b>, president of the Heritage Foundation<br><br>?Few episodes in American history are as rich in heroism and drama as the War of<br>1812, yet it has been crowded out of the popular imagination by the Revolution and the Civil War. Ron Utt&#x2019;s riveting account of the infant republic&#x2019;s epic struggle on land and sea against the greatest power of the age will make you wonder how this could have become America&#x2019;s ?forgotten war.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>?<b>Stephen Moore</b>, author and economist<br><br>?In <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i>, Ron Utt draws on previously overlooked material on the War of 1812 to vividly bring America&#x2019;s ?second war of Independence&#x2019; back to life on this its 200th anniversary.

Named in honor of the 48th state's recent admission into the union, the ship was the second and last of the Pennsylvania class of "super-dreadnought" battleships. Although commissioned in 1916, the ship remained stateside during World War I. Shortly after the end of the war, Arizona was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference. The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War to represent American interests for several months. Several years later, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and remained there for the rest of her career.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Nature of College</h2><p>Stately oaks, ivy-covered walls, the opposite sex these are the things that likely come to mind for most Americans when they think about the "nature" of college. But the real nature of college is hidden in plain sight: it&#x2019;s flowing out of the keg, it&#x2019;s woven into the mascots on our T-shirts. Engaging in a deep and richly entertaining study of "campus ecology," <i>The Nature of College</i> explores one day in the life of the average student, questioning what "natural" is and what "common sense" is really good for and weighing the collective impacts of the everyday. In the end, this fascinating, highly original book rediscovers and repurposes the great and timeless opportunity presented by college: to study the American way of life, and to develop a more sustainable, better way to live.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Lord&#39;s Prayer for Every Busy Accompanist: Revised Edition with 3 added duet arrangements (Vocal Collection)</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

He was to live among them for nineteen years, patiently and with enormous difficulty learning their ways and language, and with infinite pains leading a small band of them into the Christian faith and away from the blood lusts of their violent life.</p><p>He would eat their raw bear and moose meat, paddle many months and many miles in their canoes, build his rough chapel surrounded by their long houses, and win their respect and love. At length, joined by other "Blackrobes", Father Jean de Br�beuf erected a bit of Old France, with church and stockade, in the Canadian wilderness.</p><p>Never disturbed by fears for his own safety, Father de Br�beuf saw his village chapels burned, his converts shunned and tortured, and his fellow priests murdered by the Iroquois, the enemy of the Hurons. Finally, his own death came at their hands after incredible tortures.</p><p>This swift-paced book, more than a biography of a great saint whose story has never before been completely told in English, is a vital chapter in the tragic history of New France in North America three centuries ago, a story of the failure of colonization partially redeemed by the blood of the martyrs of the Church.</p></p><p><p><b>Francis X.

Ciulla, a noted scholar in Leadership and Ethics, examines why so many people today have let their jobs take over their lives. Technology was supposed to free us from work, but instead we work longer hours-often tethered to the office at home by cell phones and e-mail. People still look to work for self-fulfillment, community, and identity, but these things may be increasingly difficult to find in today's workplace. Gone is the social contract where employees and employers shared a sense of mutual loyalty, yet many of us still sacrifice personal time for jobs that we could lose at the drop of a stock price. Tracing the evolution of the meaning of work from Aesop to Dilbert, and critically examining the past 100 years of management practices, Ciulla asks questions that we often willfully ignore at our own peril.<br><br>*When you are on your deathbed, will you wish you had spent more time at the office?<br><br>*Why do we define ourselves by our jobs rather than by other activities we do outside of work? <br><br>*What can employers and employees promise each other in today's business environment?<br><br>Provocative and entertaining, <b>The Working Life</b> challenges us to think about the meaning of work and its impact on our lives.</p><p>Work, for most of us, is something we do, not something we think about. We may wonder whether our work is sufficiently stimulating, whether it brings in enough money, or whether it makes a difference in the grand scheme of things, but we don't often question what, in fact, work really is, and why we work in the first place. In <i>The Working Life</i>, Joanne Ciulla asks these critical questions and others, taking a philosophical, sociological, and practical look at the nature of work and its role in our lives today.<p> As Ciulla points out, we live in a work-oriented society where, even though we have more freedom and flexibility than ever and more tools to increase convenience and efficiency, our work determines our lives. We have "gone beyond the work ethic," she states, to a point where our jobs have become our primary source of identity. To understand this, Ciulla looks at the values we reflect in our choice of jobs and professions, the attitudes we express in our language for work, and the sociohistorical journey that work has taken from cursed necessity to calling. She follows the path of work in our recent past, from unregulated labor and slavery, through unionism, to the rise of the all-encompassing corporation and today's blurred lines between private and public lives. In the final section, Ciulla investigates the role that work plays in our understanding and use of time and our search for meaning.</p><p> Now teaching courses on ethics, leadership, and critical thinking at Virginia's University of Richmond, Ciulla has examined and experienced the nature of work from both sides of the managerial divide. After supporting herself through the first nine years of an academic career with bar and restaurant work, she went on to study and teach business ethics at Harvard and Wharton. These varied experiences give the book a balanced and sensitive tone, adding credibility to her insights. She supports and refines her ideas about work with the comments of philosophers, writers, sociologists, economists, management theorists, and even the narratives of popular television shows. Her sources range from Aristotle and the ancient storyteller Aesop to the early-20th-century time-study engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor, the comic strip "Dilbert," and modern-day business gurus. The diversity of perspectives is inspiring and helps--together with Ciulla's own interpretations and clear, precise prose--create a thought-provoking and stimulating look at the nature of work. <i>--S.&nbsp;Ketchum</i></p>"A wonderfully readable tour through the history of ideas about work, as human nature or human condition; as curse or blessing; as a calling by God or expression of the inner self."<br>-- Michael W. Munley, Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br>"None of my guests on World of Ideas stimulated more response from viewers than Joanne Ciulla."<br>--Bill Moyers, Public Affairs Television, Inc.</p><h2>Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith?</h2><p><p>Is historical accuracy an indispensable part of the Bible&#x2019;s storyline, or is Scripture only concerned with theological truths?

In this timely and timeless collection of essays, scholars from diverse areas of expertise lend strong arguments in support of the doctrine of inerrancy.

Mercifully, however, they are not mere regurgitations of past positions. Rather, they are informed, competent, and sometimes creative contributions that urgently deserve the widest circulation. In months and years to come, I shall repeatedly refer students and pastors to this collection.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;Few Christian convictions are of as pervasive importance as the absolute perfection of Scripture&#x2015;and few convictions fall under more perennial criticism. Hence the need for this volume, which seeks to defend the evangelical doctrine of biblical inerrancy against scholars who argue that in accommodating his truth to human understanding, God has made his Word susceptible to error. Here James Hoffmeier, Dennis Magary, and a broad range of learned colleagues take seriously the self-witness of Scripture and respond to some of the latest, hardest objections to inerrancy by providing clear, comprehensive, persuasive, and charitable answers. <em>Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith?</em> is an invaluable resource for any student of Scripture who doubts the doctrine of inerrancy or has serious questions about the historical reliability of the Bible.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;Whether in a university open forum or in the church, I am consistently asked about the trustworthiness and authority of Scripture. I am therefore delighted that the authors have engaged the critics&#x2019; challenge as well as the Bible afresh and met the arguments head-on with insightful scholarship and the historicity of Scripture. I commend this unique and timely volume and believe it will be an important work for decades to come.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ravi Zacharias</strong>, Founder and President, Ravi Zacharias International Ministries; author, <em>Jesus Among Other Gods</em></p><p>&#x201c;To scholars unconvinced of the classical Christian doctrine of Holy Scripture, <em>Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith?</em> offers a challenge both substantive in its argumentation and respectful in its tone. To scholars convinced of this doctrine, this volume models how to advance the argument on a multidisciplinary, evidentialist basis. We owe the editors and authors a debt of gratitude.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong>,&nbsp;Pastor to&nbsp;Pastors, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;The debate over biblical inerrancy is a crucial issue for evangelicals. <em>Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith?</em> is an important response to this challenge, and its essays, written by leading evangelical scholars, present a robust defense of the reliability of the historical narratives of the Bible. The book makes a compelling case that holding to inerrancy does not mean one must avoid examining the issues raised by critical scholarship, but rather the accuracy of Scripture can itself be the conclusion of a reasoned and critical examination of the evidence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michelle Lee-Barnewall</strong>, Associate Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies, Biola University; author,<em> Paul, the Stoics, and the Body of Christ</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a book that has been sorely needed. The Bible has long been under attack from those outside evangelical faith, and now more recently from those supposedly inside. Here in one volume the questions are addressed in a comprehensive way, including theological, historical-critical, and archaeological issues. Written with an irenic tone&#x2015;and yet confronting the questions directly&#x2015;this book will surely take a prominent place on the shelves of all those who love the Bible and look for solid answers to give to its detractors. The editors are to be commended for bringing the book to fruition and for their breadth of vision in organizing it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Oswalt,</strong> author, <em>Called to Be Holy</em> and <em>The NIV Application Commentary: Isaiah</em></p><p>&#x201c;James Hoffmeier and Dennis Magary have assembled a first-rate team of evangelical writers to join them in exploring the historical issues related to the interpretation of Holy Scripture and the formation of Christian theology. Each chapter makes a significant contribution to this comprehensive and focused volume&#x2015;which both affirms and defends the complete truthfulness and full authority of the Bible while fully engaging the questions and challenges raised by modern and postmodern approaches to biblical interpretation. Informative and winsome, this impressive work will be immensely helpful for a generation of students, pastors, and scholars alike.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David S. Dockery,</strong>&nbsp;Chancellor, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p><p>&#x201c;How evangelicals view the Bible has been, and continues to be, under attack. This volume effectively defends the Bible&#x2019;s historicity and adeptly explains why it matters. Any pastor or person teaching and defending the Bible will be greatly helped by this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Alistair Begg,</strong> Senior Pastor, Parkside Church, Chagrin Falls, Ohio</p><p>&#x201c;Today, some so-called evangelicals have questioned and outright denied the full extent of the inerrancy, authority, and trustworthiness of God&#x2019;s Word, claiming it may apply to faith and practice but not to history and science. As disturbing as these claims are against the Scriptures, I give thanks to God that they have prompted an excellent response, so that we now have a much stronger foundation for affirming the inerrancy of God&#x2019;s Word, including matters of history. Do Historical Matters Matter to Faith? is one of the best and most thorough treatments in defense of the Bible as completely true and trustworthy in the realm of history. It is a much-needed antidote to some so-called evangelicals&#x2019; unhealthy (and inaccurate) view of inerrancy. In matters relating to the doctrine of the Scriptures, this will be the book I recommend to pastors and leaders. It will serve them and the church well, and deserves the highest of commendations!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregory C. Strand,</strong> Director of Biblical Theology and Credentialing, Evangelical Free Church of America</p><p>&#x201c;Here is a collection of first-rate essays written by an international team of scholars, each affirming what must be called the historic Christian view of Holy Scripture&#x2015;that the Bible, God&#x2019;s Word written, is trustworthy and totally true in all that it affirms. Rather than simply rehearsing platitudes of the past, this volume advances the argument in the light of current debate and recent challenges. A magisterial undertaking to be reckoned with.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy George,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Dean and Research Professor of Divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University; general editor, Reformation Commentary on Scripture</p><p>&#x201c;In recent decades evangelicals have felt increasing pressure to abandon their high views of Scripture&#x2015;a pressure that comes not only from scholars outside their circles, but also from some inside. This volume represents a welcome response to both, but especially to the latter. The contributors represent evangelical scholarship at its best as they address critical challenges with clarity and conviction, even while keeping their tone civil and charitable. This book will serve as a handy reference tool for students, pastors, and scholars who need a fair and responsible treatment of the evidence and clear declaration of their conclusions.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel I. Block,</strong> Gunther H. Knoedler Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-first-century hubris insists on immediate answers from a Book of great antiquity that is fundamentally about God&#x2019;s intervention in human history. Yet even with advances in scientific archaeological method and modern scholarship, there is still much to learn about the Bible&#x2019;s ancient setting, language, history, and sociopolitical context. This book engages honestly with a number of thorny issues concerning the history and evidence for key biblical narratives. Its propositions are robustly defended in a clear yet scholarly fashion, making it accessible to informed lay and academic readers alike. I commend it to anyone seeking an orthodox evangelical perspective on the flash points in current debates about the historicity of the Scriptures.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Karin Sowada</strong>, CEO, Anglican Deaconess Ministries Ltd.; Hon. Research Associate, Macquarie University</p><p>&#x201c;Singapore Bible College was founded in 1952 to uphold the authority of God&#x2019;s Word at the time when the Scriptures were under severe attack from the liberals of that era. Today, we are a living testimony to the effectiveness and authority of God&#x2019;s Word as we expound a Bible-based theological education. The mocking of the Word of God did not liberate people from what the liberals claimed to be superstition or outdated scholarship. But it did destroy the faith of many poorly grounded believers, confused the church concerning her mission and purpose, created tension in the mission field, and set the church backward on many fronts in Asia and elsewhere. James Hoffmeier and Dennis Magary have assembled an able team of evangelical scholars to address and defend the issues of the authority of God&#x2019;s Word from the theological, biblical, and archaeological perspectives. They are not afraid to face the issues head-on in a comprehensive and thorough manner, yet with the right spirit. I hope this book will help many students of the Scriptures to have a deeper conviction of the authoritative and inerrant Word of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Albert Ting</strong>, Principal, Singapore Bible College</p><p>&#x201c;This volume well documents the analysis and evidence integral to understanding the role of historical data in biblical understanding.

To that effect, it is not a monument to the doctrine, but rather an advancement of its method and intent.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>C. Hassell Bullock</strong>, Pastor, Warren Park Presbyterian Church, Cicero, Illinois; Franklin&nbsp;S.

The topics discussed include all the essentials: the foundational theological issues, the major source-critical and historical-critical questions, and matters arising from archaeology. This book will be a valuable resource for both scholars and students.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Duane A. Garrett</strong>, Professor of Old Testament, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; author, <em>A Modern Grammar for Biblical Hebrew </em>and <em>Amos: A Handbook on the Hebrew Text</em><em><br></em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a brilliant response to evangelical skeptics such as Peter Enns and Kenton Sparks, and, in a broader sense, also to mainstream skeptics such as Philip Davies, Keith Whitelam, or Robert Coote. The list of contributors is a stellar lineup of first-rate scholars in their disciplines who defend the traditional, orthodox view of Scripture as historically reliable in sophisticated and convincing ways. Even those who might remain unconvinced of the book&#x2019;s main argument will have to rethink their positions. I highly recommend this work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David M. Howard Jr.,</strong> Professor of Old Testament, Bethel University, St. Paul, Minnesota</p><p>&#x201c;This book takes us to the front lines of many of the contemporary confrontations in critical scholarship, addressing the skeptics head-on. A host of able defenders contend for the trustworthiness of the Bible in the face of critical challenges and fairly criticize some of the &#x2018;assured results&#x2019; of biblical criticism&#x2015;opening the way for a more confident faith. Only the Holy Spirit himself can fully confirm the truth of God&#x2019;s Word, but he can use books like this to confound the doubter and affirm the faithful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bill Kynes,</strong> Senior Pastor, Cornerstone Evangelical Free Church, Annandale, Virginia; author, <em>A Christology of Solidarity</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a thoughtful and heartening response to Sparks and other progressive evangelicals who believe the time has come to move beyond what they perceive to be an outdated view of Scripture&#x2019;s inerrancy. Those seeking to rightly handle the word of truth (2 Tim. 2:15) will find here methodological, philosophical, theological, archaeological, and geographical resources for navigating the historical context of Scripture that call attention to its divine origins. Hoffmeier and Magary have provided a great service to the academy and church in this scholarly compilation of evangelical writers who conserve the tradition of the plenary inspiration and inerrancy of the Old and New Testament Scriptures. <em>Soli Deo gloria</em>.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Laura C.

She worked at several restaurants in New York and Connecticut before relocating to San Francisco in 2007. Once in the Bay Area, Simone worked as a personal chef while working to launch a catering company. Shortly after getting Zenbelly off the ground, Simone learned whatwas behind her constant headaches and lethargy: a pretty serious sensitivity to gluten. Discovering she had food allergies put the brakes on the business, but only long enough to pivot. Simone couldn&#x2019;t imagine serving people food she hasn&#x2019;t tasted, and recognized the tremendous need for gluten-free catering. All signs pointed to turning Zenbelly into a gluten-free catering company. And who better to do it than someone who couldn't imagine living a life restricted by food allergies? Simone is a chef on a mission: To prove that gluten-free and paleo cuisine can be just as gourmet, refined, and artfully presented as what you&#x2019;d find in a fine bistro. She draws on her holistic nutrition education to bring true nourishment to her cooking, and belies the notion that healthy food can&#x2019;t be delicious enough to impress the most serious gourmand. Simone offers a chef's perspective to paleo recipes on her blog, Zenbellyblog.com.

But when Elizabeth&#x2019;s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello- her former nemesis- she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding electrocution or, worse, falling in love.<i>Friends Without Benefits is book #2 in the Knitting in the City series.

Although a lot of information about the Masorah is available in print, most of it is in technical professional journals or encyclopedia articles. Scattered about in disparate sources, often not in English, this literature is easier to ignore than it is to incorporate into introductory Hebrew classes. As a result, most students of Biblical Hebrew complete their studies without any background on the Masorah.<br><br> This volume fills this gap by providing an introduction and glossary to the Masorah of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia. Although the volume could be used by any student of the Hebrew Bible, it is specifically designed to be helpful for students who are just learning Hebrew. Thus it can serve as an important parallel text for second semester or second year Hebrew courses.<br><br> The introductory chapters give an overview of the field of Masoretic studies and explain the mechanics of using the Masorah of BHS. The annotated glossary provides students with definitions and explanations for most of the terms used in BHS, including examples.</p><p></p><h2>Extraordinary Cakes: Recipes for Bold and Sophisticated Desserts</h2><p>How to make cakes that are as delicious to eat as they are beautiful to behold. Karen Krasne, the &#x201c;Queen of Cakes&#x201d; according to <i>Gourmet</i> magazine, brings a fresh and contemporary sensibility to special-occasion cakes. Instead of the conventional fondant and gum paste, she relies on natural frostings based on chocolate, cream, or butter (which are also easier to make). What makes these cakes showstoppers is their unexpected flavor combinations-take, for example, the Blood Orange Ricotta Torte, the Chocolate Tiramisu, or the Yuzu Tea Cake. These desserts take full advantage of layering-contrasting textures in each bite-as seen in the New York, New York (chocolate ganache, devil&#x2019;s food cake, chocolate chantilly, and caramelized apples) or the Beau Soleil (mascarpone mousse, peaches, pralines, and honey-soaked pound cake). Krasne favors vibrant touches like fresh fruit and real flowers, which add flair without being fussy. The recipes include tips from her twenty years as a pastry chef, and a step-by-step introduction covers basic techniques. <i>Extraordinary Cakes</i> shows how to create amazing cakes that satisfy sophisticated palates-but are still achievable for the home baker.<br><br>Some of the luscious cakes included are Toasted Macadamia Caramel Cheesecake, Shangrila (Guava Mousse, White Chocolate Mousse, Fresh Strawberries, Pound Cake), Vallarta (Key Lime Cream, Whipped Cream, Tequla-Infused Genoise), Marco Polo (Vanilla Mousse, Blackberry Gelee, Tea-Infused Cake), Chocolate Nirvana (Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cream, Chocolate Cake), King Kamehameha (Coffee Mousse, Chocolate, Mocha Pralines, Chocolate Cake), Beau Soleil (Marscapone Mousse, Peaches, Caramelized Pralines, Honey, Pound Cake), Blood Orange Ricotta Torte, Carnaval (White Chocolate Banana Truffle, Chocolate Mousse, Rum), Caribe (Banana, Mango, Passion Fruit, Chocolate Cake), Tortamisu (Marscapone Cream, Espresso-and-Rum-Soaked Cake).</p><p><b>Karen Krasne</b> is the owner and executive chef of Extraordinary Desserts, San Diego&#x2019;s number one destination restaurant for desserts for the last twenty years.

Now, in <em>Lincoln: A Very Short Introduction</em>, the award-winning Lincoln authority Allen C. Guelzo offers a penetrating look into the mind of one of our greatest presidents.<br><br>If Lincoln was famous for reading aloud from joke books, Guelzo shows that he also plunged deeply into the mainstream of nineteenth-century liberal democratic thought. Guelzo takes us on a wide-ranging exploration of problems that confronted Lincoln and liberal democracy--equality, opportunity, the rule of law, slavery, freedom, peace, and his legacy. The book sets these problems and Lincoln's responses against the larger world of American and trans-Atlantic liberal democracy in the 19th century, comparing Lincoln not just to Andrew Jackson or John Calhoun, but to British thinkers such as Richard Cobden, Jeremy Bentham, and John Bright, and to French observers Alexis de Tocqueville and Fran�ois Guizot. The Lincoln we meet here is an Enlightenment figure who struggled to create a common ground between a people focused on individual rights and a society eager to establish a certain moral, philosophical, and intellectual bedrock. Lincoln insisted that liberal democracy had a higher purpose, which was the realization of a morally right political order. But how to interject that sense of moral order into a system that values personal self-satisfaction--"the pursuit of happiness"--remains a fundamental dilemma even today.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln was a man who, according to his friend and biographer William Henry Herndon, "lived in the mind." Guelzo paints a marvelous portrait of this Lincoln--Lincoln the man of ideas--providing new insights into one of the giants of American history.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

The book examines 13 core philosophical problems and demonstrates how each is illustrated through the events and characters of the Matrix trilogy. We see how Morpheus manifests Kierkegaard&#39;s philosophy of faith; how libertarian, determinist, and compatibilist views of free will find expression in the characters of Neo, the Merovingian, and Ghost; and how Neo&#39;s belief in objective values is challenged by Agent Smith. The book focuses squarely on the Matrix films, with plenty of quotes and other tie-ins, but it is also packed with philosophical content. By the end of the book, readers will be well acquainted with key issues in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, race and gender, existentialism, Taoism, and mysticism.<b>It&#x2019;s the questions that drive us.</b> <br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>What is real?<br> </li> <li>How do you know what is real?<br> </li> <li>Can we be certain that we are not in a Matrix ourselves?<br> </li> <li>Does free will exist inside the Matrix?

War and peace, military strategy, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and revisionist states remain central to the discussion, but concerns such as climate change, migration, poverty, health, and international terrorism have complicated the field. So what really matters: the traditional prioritization of state security or the security needs of individuals, humanity, and the biosphere? <br><br>Using a broad range of international examples, Christopher Browning outlines the nature of the key debates about contemporary international security challenges, and discusses the inherent difficulties that exist in tackling them. He also asks to what extent such debates are infused with questions of power, politics, justice, morality, and responsibility.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every <em>Very Short Introduction</em> gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library.

It balances a detailed discussion of theories and selected research with applied examples that ensure the material is relevant to students. Newly revised and updated, this edition addresses several interlocking themes, such as research methods, the development of prejudice in children, the relationship between prejudice and discrimination, and discrimination in the workplace, which are developed in greater detail than in other textbooks.</p> <p></p> <p>The first theme introduced is the nature of prejudice and discrimination, which is followed by a discussion of research methods. Next comes the psychological underpinnings of prejudice: the nature of stereotypes, the conditions under which stereotypes influence responses to other people, contemporary theories of prejudice, and how values and belief systems are related to prejudice. Explored next are the development of prejudice in children and the social context of prejudice. The theme of discrimination is developed via discussions of the nature of discrimination, the experience of discrimination, and specific forms of discrimination, including gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, and appearance. The concluding theme is the reduction of prejudice. </p> <p></p> <p>An ideal core text for junior and senior college students who have had a course in introductory psychology, it is written in a style that is accessible to students in other fields including education, social work, business, communication studies, ethnic studies, and other disciplines. In addition to courses on prejudice and discrimination, this book is also adapted for courses that cover topics in racism and diversity.</p> <p>For instructor resources, consult the companion website (http://www.routledge.com/cw/Kite), which includes an Instructor Manual that contains activities and tools to help with teaching a prejudice and discrimination course; PowerPoint slides for every chapter; and a Test Bank with exam questions for every chapter for a total of over 1,700 questions.</p></p><p><p><strong>Mary E.

Tabors was an elementary school teacher and a childbirth educator. During her doctoral studies she focused on first and second language acquisition in young children. Her qualifying paper and dissertation research, based on 2 years of ethnographic investigation in a nursery school classroom, described the developmental pathway of a group of young children learning English as a second language. She was able to use this information as the basis for the material in <i>One Child, Two Languages: A Guide for Preschool Educators of Children Learning English as a Second Language</i> (Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co., 1997). Since 1987, Dr. Tabors was the research coordinator of the Home-School Study of Language and Literacy Development in collaboration with Catherine Snow and David Dickinson. During this time she also directed research related to low-education and low-income mothers reading to their preschool-age children as part of the Manpower Development Research Corporation evaluations of two welfare-to-work projects, New Chance and JOBS, and for the Harvard Language Diversity Project, a subproject of the New England Research Center on Head Start Quality, directed by David Dickinson. Dr. Tabors's latest research, a longitudinal project that was following the language and literacy development of Spanish-speaking children from preschool to second grade, combined her interests in early language and literacy development and second language acquisition in young children. <p></p><br><br> Dr. Snow is the Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. She received her doctorate in psychology from McGill University and worked for several years in the linguistics department of the University of Amsterdam. Her research interests include children's language development as influenced by interaction with adults in home and preschool settings, literacy development as related to language skills and as influenced by home and school factors, and issues related to the acquisition of English oral and literacy skills by language minority children. She has co-authored books on language development (e.g., Pragmatic Development: Essays in Developmental Science, co-authored with Anat Ninio [Westview Press, 1996]) and on literacy development (e.g., Unfulfilled Expectations: Home and School Influences on Literacy, co-authored with Wendy S. Barnes, Lowry Hemphill, Jean Chandler, and Irene F. Goodman [iUniverse.com, 2000]) and has published widely on these topics in refereed journals and edited volumes. Dr. Snow's contributions to the field include serving on several journal editorial boards, as co-director of the Child Language Data Exchange System for several years, and as editor of Applied Psycholinguistics. She served as a board member at the Center for Applied Linguistics and was a member of the National Research Council Committee on Establishing a Research Agenda on Schooling for Language Minority Children. She also chaired the National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children, which produced a report that has been widely adopted as a basis for reform of reading instruction and professional development. She currently serves on the NRC's Council for the Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education and is President of the American Educational Research Association. A member of the National Academy of Education, Dr. Snow has held visiting appointments at the University of Cambridge, England, Universidad Autónoma in Madrid, and The Institute of Advanced Studies at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and has guest taught at Universidad Central de Caracas in Venezuela, El Colegio de Mexico, Odense University in Denmark, and several institutions in The Netherlands. <br><b>Download an excerpt</b><br><br><b>Observing Children Learning English (OCLE)</b><br><br></p><h2>Chemistry for the IB Diploma Coursebook</h2><p>Chemistry for the IB Diploma, Second edition, covers in full the requirements of the IB syllabus for Chemistry for first examination in 2016.

A VHDL description is also source code, and VHDL designers can use the best practices of software development to write high-quality code and to organize it in a design. This book presents this unique set of skills, teaching VHDL designers of all experience levels how to apply the best design principles and coding practices from the software world to the world of hardware. The concepts introduced here will help readers write code that is easier to understand and more likely to be correct, with improved readability, maintainability, and overall quality.</p><p>After a brief review of VHDL, the book presents fundamental design principles for writing code, discussing such topics as design, quality, architecture, modularity, abstraction, and hierarchy. Building on these concepts, the book then introduces and provides recommendations for each basic element of VHDL code, including statements, design units, types, data objects, and subprograms. The book covers naming data objects and functions, commenting the source code, and visually presenting the code on the screen. All recommendations are supported by detailed rationales. Finally, the book explores two uses of VHDL: synthesis and testbenches. It examines the key characteristics of code intended for synthesis (distinguishing it from code meant for simulation) and then demonstrates the design and implementation of testbenches with a series of examples that verify different kinds of models, including combinational, sequential, and FSM code.

A focus on the behavior of the operations allows students starting in the familiar territory of number and computation to progress to true engagement in the discipline of mathematics."</em></p> <p>-Susan Jo Russell, Deborah Schifter, and Virginia Bastable</p> <p>Algebra readiness: it's a topic of concern that seems to pervade every school district. How can we better prepare elementary students for algebra? More importantly, how can we help <em>all</em> children, not just those who excel in math, become ready for later instruction? The answer lies not in additional content, but in developing a way of thinking about the mathematics that underlies both arithmetic and algebra. <br> <br> <em>Connecting Arithmetic to Algebra</em> invites readers to learn about a crucial component of algebraic thinking: investigating the behavior of the operations. Nationally-known math educators <strong>Susan Jo Russell, Deborah Schifter</strong>, and <strong>Virginia Bastable</strong> and a group of collaborating teachers describe how elementary teachers can shape their instruction so that students learn to:<br> *notice and describe consistencies across problems<br> *articulate generalizations about the behavior of the operations<br> *develop mathematical arguments based on representations to explain why such generalizations are or are not true.<br> <br> Through such work, students become familiar with properties and general rules that underlie computational strategies-including those that form the basis of strategies used in algebra-strengthening their understanding of grade-level content and at the same time preparing them for future studies.<br> <br> Each chapter is illustrated by lively episodes drawn from the classrooms of collaborating teachers in a wide range of settings. These provide examples of posing problems, engaging students in productive discussion, using representations to develop mathematical arguments, and supporting both students with a wide range of learning profiles.<br> <br> Staff Developers: Available online, the Course Facilitator's Guide provides math leaders with tools and resources for implementing a Connecting Arithmetic to Algebra workshop or preservice course.<br> For information on the PD course offered through Mount Holyoke College, download the flyer.</p></p><p><p>Susan Jo Russell is a principal scientist at the Education Research Collaborative at TERC.

This study pushes our vocabulary about the woman of color past the usual platitudes about objectification and past the critique of Orientalism in order to formulate a fresher and sharper understanding of the representation, circulation, and ontology of Asiatic femininity. This book alters the foundational terms of racialized femininity by allowing us to conceptualize race and gender without being solely beholden to flesh or skin. Tracing a direct link between the making of Asiatic femininity and a technological history of synthetic personhood in the West from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century, <em>Ornamentalism</em> demonstrates how the construction of modern personhood in the multiple realms of law, culture, and art has been surprisingly indebted to this very marginal figure and places Asian femininity at the center of an entire epistemology of race. <br><br>Drawing from and speaking to the multiple fields of feminism, critical race theory, visual culture, performance studies, legal studies, Modernism, Orientalism, Object Studies and New Materialism, <em>Ornamentalism</em> will leave reader with a greater understanding of what it is to exist as a "person-thing" within the contradictions of American culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anne Anlin Cheng</strong> is Professor of English and Director of American Studies at Princeton University. She is also affiliated with the University's Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies and Committee on Film Studies. Her most recent book is <em>Second Skin: Josephine Baker &amp; the Modern Surface</em> (OUP 2011).<br><br>"What Anne Cheng looks to offer in her new monograph <em>Ornamentalism</em> is a heretofore-missing theory of Asiatic femininity ... <em>Ornamentalism</em> offers an alternative vision of agency as not resistance but resilience, of forms of living produced under impossible conditions -- providing, too, a much-needed concretization of post-humanism's rhetorical gestures." -- Chalay Chalermkraivuth, <em>Brink</em><p></p><br>"Through a constellation of mesmerizing scenes- from the courtroom to the museum to the sushi bar, from early photographs to cyberfiction film- Anne Anlin Cheng reveals the drama of ornamentalism in Anglo-American culture: the ontological force with which Asiatic femininity resides in an aesthetics of ornamental personhood. Within the dynamics of this drama- conflating the abstract and the corporeal, the figural and the real- personhood and objecthood ineluctably converge. Above all <em>Ornamentalism</em> tracks new and essential questions for the study of racialized gender." --Bill Brown, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"A worthy successor to Edward W. Said's <em>Orientalism</em>, Cheng's <em>Ornamentalism</em> contours the breadth of ornamentation's enmeshment with orientalist logics and poses socially pertinent questions regarding the distinctive ways in which Blackness and Asianness are visualized and adorned." --Rache l Lee, University of California, Los Angeles<p></p><br>"This bold and astonishingly original book is many things at once. Attending to the ways in which race and beauty troublingly but also pleasurably intertwine, it begins as a study of comparative racialization that shows how the dehumanization of persons transpires differently: some by being reduced to flesh and biology, others, by being turned into artificial shells. A much needed theorization of Asiatic femininity in the Western imagination that thinks without moralizations, Ornamentalism is a brilliant, groundbreaking book that shows how the ideology of race renders subjects excessively visible but also simultaneously hard to see." --Sianne Ngai, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"This is a stunning critical-historical unpacking of the figure of the 'Asiatic yellow woman' as a peripheral person/object, exotic/erotic, she/it. This haunted 'theory of being' nudges and advocates a fuller critique adding to #MeToo universalism and the shorthand of 'black and brown' women and fem bodies-opening a more decolonizing internationalist theory of raced, gendered, and sexualized intimacies, differentiation, and power." --John Kuo Wei Tchen, Rutgers University-Newark<p></p><br></p><h2>Begin Database Design W / WS</h2><p>This book is intended for IT professionals and students who want to learn how to design, analyze, and understand databases. The material will benefit those who want a better high-level understanding of databases such as proposal managers, architects, project managers, and even customers. The material will also benefit those who will actually design, build, and work with databases such as database designers, database administrators, and programmers. In many projects, these roles overlap so the same person may be responsible for working on the proposal, managing part of the project, and designing and creating the database. <p>This book is aimed at IT professionals and students of all experience levels. It does not assume that you have any previous experience with databases or programs that use them. It doesn&#x2019;t even assume that you have experience with computers. All you really need is a willingness and desire to learn.</p> <p>This book explains database design. It tells how to plan a database&#x2019;s structure so the database will be robust, resistant to errors, and flexible enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of future change. It explains how to discover database requirements, build data models to study data needs, and refine those models to improve the database&#x2019;s effectiveness.</p> <p>The book solidifies these concepts by working through a detailed example that designs a realistic database. Later chapters explain how to actually build databases using two common database products: Access 2007 and MySQL.</p> <p>The book finishes by describing some of the topics you need to understand to keep a database running effectively such as database maintenance and security.</p> <p>This book explains database design. It tells how to determine what should go in a database and how the database should be structured to give the best results.</p> <p>To remain database neutral, the book does not assume you are using a particular database so you don&#x2019;t need any particular software or hardware. To work through the Exercises, all you really need is a pencil and some paper. You are welcome to type solutions into your computer if you like but you may actually find working with pencil and paper easier than using a graphical design tool to draw pictures, at least until you are comfortable with database design and are ready to pick a computerized design tool.</p></p><p><p>Beginning Database Design Solutions</p> <p>Databases play a critical role in the business operations of most organizations; they're the central repository for critical information on products, customers, suppliers, sales, and a host of other essential information.

Born on the Standing Rock reservation in South Dakota in 1896, she was largely self-taught. Steeped in the visual traditions of beadwork, quilling, and hide painting, she also engaged with the experiments in time, space, symbolism, and representation characteristic of early twentieth-century modernist art. And like her great-grandfather Sully was fascinated by celebrity: over two decades, she produced hundreds of colorful and dynamic abstract triptychs, a series of "personality prints" of American public figures like Amelia Earhart, Babe Ruth, and Gertrude Stein.<br><br>Sully's position on the margins of the art world meant that her work was exhibited only a handful of times during her life. In <i>Becoming Mary Sully</i>, Philip J. Deloria reclaims that work from obscurity, exploring her stunning portfolio through the lenses of modernism, industrial design, Dakota women's aesthetics, mental health, ethnography and anthropology, primitivism, and the American Indian politics of the 1930s. Working in a complex territory oscillating between representation, symbolism, and abstraction, Sully evoked multiple and simultaneous perspectives of time and space. With an intimate yet sweeping style, Deloria recovers in Sully's work a move toward an anti-colonial aesthetic that claimed a critical role for Indigenous women in American Indian futures&#x2015;within and distinct from American modernity and modernism.</p><p><b>Philip J.

So do the interpretations offered by her great-nephew Phil Deloria. Deloria argues that Sully was a 'native to modernism,' an extraordinary early twentieth-century talent whose personality prints disrupt the categories of American Indian and modernist art genres. Once again, Deloria sets the bar for brilliant Indigenous scholarship that elevates our understandings of our shared&#x2015;Indigenous and non-Indigenous&#x2015;world."&#x2015;K. Tsianina Lomawaima, School of Social Transformation, Arizona State University</p><p>"In an astonishing act of recovery, Becoming Mary Sully reorients the study of Native American aesthetics. Through prodigious research and creative analysis, Phil Deloria locates his great-aunt's life and work within the broader currents of American cultural history and in the process challenges the often unhelpful disciplinary boundaries that disconnect "American" and "American Indian" art. A wonderful addition."&#x2015;Ned Blackhawk, professor of history and American studies, Yale University</p></p><h2>Methodical Realism: A Handbook for Beginning Realists</h2><p>This short book is a work of one of the 20th century&#39;s greatest philosophers and historians of philosophy, Etienne Gilson. The book&#39;s title, taken from the first chapter, may sound esoteric but it reflects a common-sense outlook on the world, applied in a methodical way. That approach, known as realism, consists in emphasizing the fact that what is real precedes our concepts about it. In contrast to realism stands idealism, which refers to the philosophical outlook that begins with ideas and tries to move from them to things.Gilson shows how the common-sense notion of realism, though denied by many thinkers, is indispensible for a correct understanding of things--of what is and how we know what is. He shows the flaws of idealism and he critiques efforts to introduce elements of idealism into realist philosophy (immediate realism). At the same time, the author criticizes failures of certain realist philosophers--including Aristotle--to be consistent in their own principles and to begin from sound starting points. To these problems, Gilson traces medieval philosophy&#39;s failure in the realm of science, which led early modern scientific thinkers of the 17th century unnecessarily to reject even the best of medieval scholastic philosophy.He concludes with The Realist Beginner&#39;s Handbook, a summary of key points for thinking clearly about reality and about the knowledge of it.</p><p><b>Etienne Gilson</b>&nbsp;(1884-1978) was a renowned French philosopher and historian of philosophy, and a member of the prestigious French Academy.

Vreeland created &#x201c;Why Don&#x2019;t You?&#x201d;&#x2014;an illustrated column of irreverent advice for chic living. Soon she was named the magazine&#x2019;s fashion editor&#x2014;a position that Richard Avedon later famously credited Vreeland with inventing. &nbsp;The troika of Snow, legendary art director Alexey Brodovitch, and Vreeland formed a creative collaboration that continued <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar&#x2019;s</i> dominance as America&#x2019;s leading fashion magazine.

"While McCartney is of a completely different cast than Bob Dylan, his appeal may be even greater than that of the latter great poet-songwriter," wrote <em>Publishers Weekly; The Guardian</em> hailed McCartney's words as "a remarkable feat of historical imagination." The best-selling <em>Blackbird Singing</em> now includes several new poems and lyrics, including "Freedom," which McCartney performed in New York City at a benefit concert last fall. To actually read McCartney's poems, whether exuberant ballads of love or poignant messages of deepest grief, is to appreciate the electrifying power of the confluence of dream and song. Inspired by his late wife, Linda McCartney, <em>Blackbird Singing</em> gives us extraordinary access to the inner life of one of the most influential figures of our time.</p><p>It is nearly impossible to scan any of Paul McCartney's lyrics without hearing the Beatles' music in the background, dictating rhythm, pace, and mood. But as <i>Blackbird Singing</i> demonstrates, the effort is worth making. This first collection brings together early and late poems, along with some of Sir Paul's greatest hits (including the words to "Yesterday," "Lady Madonna," "Penny Lane," and "Hey Jude.") In his introduction, editor and fellow Liverpudlian Adrian Mitchell urges readers to "wash out the name and the fame" and examine what's on the page. If you can do this, you're in for a pleasant surprise.<p> True, some of the lyrics appear trite on paper--"Heart of the Country" and "Mull of Kintyre" are notable offenders. Even "Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" seems naked and frail without the rousing brass section. But McCartney's deeper vulnerability comes to the surface in "Dinner Tickets," a poem about his childhood. And "Standing Stone" recounts a gutsy fable about a man using the power of imagination to fend off the enemy: he erects a standing stone, "a weathered finger to the sky" and learns to be "at peace with peace." "Irish Language" boasts a rare streak of irony as the narrator admires the way "those Irish chappies" swill the language around in their mouths and dribble it through their fingers. The song ends with a beautifully timed punch line: "The Beatles were a bunch of Micks." <i>Blackbird Singing</i> closes with poems dedicated to the author's late wife that are tender, sparse, and startlingly honest. <i>--Cherry Smyth</i></p>Sir Paul McCartney is one of the most admired contemporary poets and songwriters.

DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science-fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned to deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film, notably, <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>. The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes. His work has been translated into&nbsp;twenty-five languages.<p></p>Set in the middle of the twenty-first century, <b>The Simulacra</b> is the story of an America where the whole government is a fraud and the President is an android. Against this backdrop Dr. Superb, the sole remaining psychotherapist, is struggling to practice in a world full of the maladjusted. Ian Duncan is desperately in love with the first lady, Nicole Thibideaux, who he has never met. Richard Kongrosian refuses to see anyone because he is convinced his body odor is lethal. And the fascistic Bertold Goltz is trying to overthrow the government. With wonderful aplomb, Philip K. Dick brings this story to a crashing conclusion and in classic fashion shows there is always another layer of conspiracy beneath the one we see.</p><h2>Jane Nickerson&#39;s Florida Cookbook</h2><p><b>The food columnist of the New York Times&#x2019; Florida newspapers presents a feast of tested recipes typical of a state famed for its fine foods.</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;As you&#x2019;d expect, Jane&#x2019;s cookbook has a fine group of vegetable and salad recipes, but it does not neglect the other parts of Florida cuisine&#x2014;appetizers; poultry, meats and game; fish and shellfish; breads and other cereal products; desserts; preserves.

At present, the root causes of most chronic diseases are still unknown, and the drugs developed by pharmaceutical companies to treat chronic diseases actually treat only the symptoms rather than causes. According to Dr. Monte Lai, a nutrient deficient diet and unhealthy lifestyle are by far the two most important environmental factors associated with the causes of a host of chronic diseases. <i>The Vitamin Cure</i> provides a comprehensive overview of how vitamin and essential element therapies are the key to treating and preventing many of the chronic conditions.<br><br>While the internet is chock full of health related information about vitamins and essential elements, it is difficult to sort through all available information to build a reliable knowledge base to improve health. The aim of this book is to provide readers with easily accessible evidence-based knowledge about vitamins and essential elements for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. <i>The Vitamin Cure</i> relies on a statistical method known as meta-analysis (combining data from multiple studies) that is currently the most reliable method for assessing the efficacy of vitamins or essential elements in preventing or treating chronic diseases.<br><br><i>The Vitamin Cure</i> brings clinically proven remedies to light for any reader looking to improve overall health and prevent debilitating disease. This book contains five parts. Part one contains a brief history of the discovery of each of the thirteen essential vitamins, namely, vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B9, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. It also presents meta-analytic evidence of the efficacy of each vitamin in prevention and treatment of diseases, its recommended daily allowance and best food sources. Part two covers essential elements, including the five essential elements, i.e., calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium and phosphorous, and the eight essential trace elements, i.e., iron, zinc, manganese, copper, molybdenum, iodine, chromium and selenium. It also presents meta-analytic evidence of the efficacy of each essential element in prevention and treatment of diseases, its recommended daily allowance and best food sources. Part three explains important secrets for staying healthy. These include explanation of how sugar makes you fat, why patients with autoimmune diseases should not eat meat, and how exercise benefits the brain? Part four provides meta-analysis evidence of which vitamins and essential elements should be taken to prevent and/or treat seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions. These seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions include lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, blood cancer, bladder cancer, glioma, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, cataracts, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, hepatitis C, fatty liver disease, Parkinson's disease, sleep apnea, and others. Part five summarizes clinically proven remedies for preventing and treating the seventy-five chronic diseases and conditions presented in Part four.<br></p><p>Dr. Monte Lai is formerly a professor of biophysics at the Medical College of Wisconsin, where his research focused on the field of free radicals in biology and medicine.

With the intellectual rigor of a scientist and the heart of a poet, Saulitis gives voice to these vital yet vanishing survivors and the place they are so loyal to. Both an elegy for one orca family and a celebration of the entire species, <i>Into Great Silence</i> is a moving portrait of the interconnectedness of humans with animals and place&#x2014;and of the responsibility we have to protect them.</p><p><b>Eva Saulitis</b> has studied whales in Prince William Sound, the Kenai Fjords, and Alaska&#x2019;s Aleutian Islands for the past twenty-four years. In addition to her scientific publications, her essays, poems, and reviews have appeared in numerous national journals, including <i>Orion, Crazyhorse</i>, and <i>Prairie Schooner</i>. The author of&nbsp;the essay collection <i>Leaving Resurrection</i> and the poetry collection <i>Many Ways to Say It</i>, she teaches at Kenai Peninsula College, in the low-residency MFA program at the University of Alaska, and at the Kachemak Bay Writers&#x2019; Conference. She lives in Homer, Alaska.From the Prologue<br><br><i>Like the others the last one fell into its shadow.</i><br> It fell into its shadow on the water.<br> <i>They took it away its shadow stayed on the water.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;W.S. Merwin, from &#x201c;The Last One&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I knew there was such thing as a species, much less one that was endangered, I understood extinction.&nbsp; When I was nine years old, I understood extinction not with my mind, but with my heart.&nbsp; Aptly, I received this instruction not at school, but after, on an ABC After School Special called <i>The Last of the Curlews</i>, based on a novel by Fred Bodsworth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t remember the film&#x2019;s plot.&nbsp; Only that at some point, there was one pair of curlews left.&nbsp; I vaguely remember a father and son who debated whether or not to shoot a curlew.&nbsp; I recall with clarity the last one, the last Eskimo curlew on earth, circling and calling above the tundra.&nbsp; In the bird&#x2019;s own memory, I imagined a sky darkened and drummed to life by bodies, wings and the <i>tr tr tr</i>-ing of flight-song, an era when it migrated between the Canadian Arctic and Patagonia with millions of other Eskimo curlews. I can still summon my ache for that last curlew; almost 40 years later, it throbs in my chest. <br><br>When I was 23, I saw my first orca, a lone female.&nbsp; That day, I had no inkling that I would study her kin for my entire adult life, that she was already one of the last ones.&nbsp; Fresh out of college, I&#x2019;d taken a job at a fish hatchery in Prince William Sound, Alaska.&nbsp; One blustery winter day, out for a skiff ride, I spotted a black fin amid gray waves.&nbsp; A few minutes later, a <i>whoosh</i> near the skiff startled me.&nbsp; I turned to see a wind-flattened blow, the fin rising, the arch of a flank emerging and sliding back under the water.&nbsp; Then she disappeared, as if the rough sea had swallowed her.&nbsp; I looked everywhere, but she was gone.&nbsp; <br><br> Twenty-five years later, I&#x2019;m still searching for that whale, for what&#x2019;s left of her family.&nbsp; For me, watching the <i>Last of the Curlews</i> was what Susan Cerulean calls an &#x201c;origin moment.&#x201d;&nbsp; That day, when I realized human beings could eliminate a kind of bird from the earth, my assumptions about the world overturned. <br><br> A lifetime of origin moments leads to this one.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s September, 2011.&nbsp; I sit on our research boat, <i>Natoa</i>, scanning a familiar shoreline for orca blows.&nbsp; The tide is low.&nbsp; A raft of sea otters rests near Squire Point.&nbsp; For many seasons, I followed small groups of orcas called Chugach transients past this point as they hunted for harbor seals.&nbsp; Sometimes, harbor seals hauled out on Squire Point to rest, or hunkered in the shallows alongside the rock to hide from passing orcas.&nbsp; Though I see no seals sprawled on the rock today, I know orcas might appear at any moment.&nbsp; They are like that, unpredictable in their appearances and disappearances.&nbsp; <br><br> And so are stories we tell about them.&nbsp; Take today.&nbsp; As we idle along the point, Craig, my partner in research and in life, recalls that 35 years ago, with a cadre of volunteer observers on the bluff top on Squire Island, he watched Chugach transients swim along this shoreline.&nbsp; A young field assistant, eye pressed to the lens of a spotting scope, shouted:&nbsp; &#x201c;Look, the orcas are playing with a porpoise!&#x201d;&nbsp; That evening, after hiking back down from the bluff to their tents on a beach we still call Whale Camp, they found the severed lungs, heart and head of a porpoise calf washed up on shore.&nbsp; &#x201c;I tried to preserve the skull, but the porpoise was so young, the bones just fell apart,&#x201d; Craig says.&nbsp; With Craig, I&#x2019;ve studied orcas for 25 years, nearly half my life, and I&#x2019;ve never heard that story before.&nbsp; What I know, after all this time, about the whale called orca, <i>arlluk</i>, <i>aglu</i>, blackfish, killer whale &#x2013; is a lot like that. <br><br> Now our boat rounds the bend of Squire Island, and Whale Camp beach slides into view.&nbsp; Many times, Chugach transients swam past Whale Camp when I lived there.&nbsp; Often they startled my field assistant and me from our tasks.&nbsp; Some still pass this way.&nbsp; But it won&#x2019;t always be so.&nbsp; I force myself to write the words:&nbsp; The Chugach transients are going extinct.&nbsp; They are leaving the earth under my watch.&nbsp; There will, perhaps in my lifetime, be a last one.&nbsp; I type the words, and that old hurt I felt for the Eskimo curlew throbs.&nbsp; How do I accept the reality of that word &#x2013; extinction?&nbsp; Forty years later, do I understand with my heart, much less my head, what it means?<br> &nbsp;<br> Last summer, from an unexpected angle, I got closer to understanding the concept when I edged up to &#x2013; no, was shoved toward &#x2013; the possibility of my own extinction.&nbsp; From a sick-bed, my laptop open on my lap, cell phone on the coverlet beside me, I followed the movements of Chenega, one of the last Chugach transient matriarchs, on a computer screen.&nbsp; I stared as a digitized map of Prince William Sound drew itself, then displayed the points and lines of her night-time travels.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Off Point Helen.&nbsp; I clicked on the biggest dot, the most recent satellite hit.&nbsp; 4:30 am, heading south.&nbsp; The dots told me only that much.&nbsp; Not if she traveled alone.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d been with her companions, Iktua and Mike, when Craig had tagged her the night before.&nbsp; <br> A sea-breeze drug my eyes across the carpet, the couch, the coffee table piled with get-well cards to a window.&nbsp; There, my eyes met not the Pacific, but the Atlantic; not Prince William Sound, but Cape Cod Bay, where wind left white claw marks on the indigo surface.&nbsp; For the first time in 24 years, I was not in Prince William Sound studying orcas in summer.&nbsp; I clicked on the link to the Iridium website, typed a satellite text-message to Craig and our friend Cy, who was filling in for me on the boat. <br><br>I shut the computer, pushed it to the side of the bed, sank down against the pillows, closed my eyes.&nbsp; Before I rose to my reality, the fact that the day before, in a Boston hospital, an IV had pumped a toxic chemical into a vein on top of my left hand, the fact that I was being treated for breast cancer, and downstairs, what awaited me was a regimen of anti-nausea meds swallowed with a few baby spoons of applesauce, before I faced that I was not there, in Prince William Sound, not even near, that it was humid and hot every day where I was and not rainy and cool, before any of that, I placed myself in Knight Island Passage at dusk, off Squire Point, in the rain, on <i>Natoa</i> with Craig and Cy, and I tried to recreate the encounter Craig had described on the sat-phone the night before. How Chenega had been hunting with Iktua and Mike all afternoon, impossible to approach as transients so often are.&nbsp; How Craig and Cy had given up.&nbsp; It was late.&nbsp; The shelter of Sanctuary Bay beckoned.&nbsp; They were wet and cold and frustrated.&nbsp; How they&#x2019;d turned east, Craig taking the wheel inside the boat cabin, Cy enjoying a few minutes of solitude on the bridge, watching the hidden entrance to Sanctuary Bay reveal itself.&nbsp; How she&#x2019;d appeared beside the boat.&nbsp; How she&#x2019;d swum alongside the bow, lunging out of the water to keep up the pace.&nbsp; How Cy had stamped his foot on the cabin roof to signal Craig.&nbsp; How Craig had poked his head out, heard Cy shout,&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chenega, right here, I think she wants you to tag her now.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br>How Craig had tagged, easily, with one shot, one of the last seven Chugach transients.&nbsp; That was why, from thousands of miles and a continent away, I could call her up each morning and see where she was.&nbsp; That&#x2019;s how I could track an animal that exemplified fidelity to place, fidelity against all odds, in sickness and in health, in peace and calamity.<br><br> I&#x2019;d been told by healers to visualize my immune system preying on cancer cells.&nbsp; I&#x2019;d been told visualization could lessen chemotherapy&#x2019;s side-effects and speed up healing.&nbsp; So I visualized.&nbsp; The animals, the place.&nbsp; I visualized kayaking into Sanctuary Bay, where Chenega, Mike and Iktua milled, waiting.&nbsp; I drifted into their midst and placed my hand on Chenega&#x2019;s fin, placed my hand on the cold, rubbery skin, knowing hot, oxygen-rich blood flowed inside, and I imagined her red and white blood cells traveling up my arm, infusing my own blood with power.<br><br>The next time Craig called, he told me he&#x2019;d photographed all of the remaining seven Chugach transients:&nbsp; Chenega, Iktua, Egagutak, Mike, Marie, Ewan, Paddy. <br> All that hot, humid summer, I sat at a desk each day I was able, or I sat with the laptop propped open on my lap in bed, and I wrote their stories.&nbsp; In doing so I understood, not just with my head, not just with my heart, but with my body, that certain places on this earth have healing power, and that the place where the Chugach transients live is one.&nbsp; I came to believe that the place and the whales played a part in rescuing me.&nbsp; Not in some mystical sense, but simply by existing, with or without me.&nbsp; They saved me, though I can&#x2019;t save them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br>Now a year has passed.&nbsp; I&#x2019;m back in Prince William Sound, back on <i>Natoa</i>, short-haired, body altered, a strange, new post-chemo ringing in my ears, one I hear only when it&#x2019;s quiet.&nbsp; But as always in August, my fingertips are blueberry-stained.&nbsp; As always, resident orcas appear in the passages to feed on silver salmon.&nbsp; As always, salmon spawn and die by the millions in streams.&nbsp; Craig douses bucketfuls of saltwater over four silver salmon he&#x2019;s caught off Whale Camp beach.&nbsp; As always, we search the shorelines for Chugach transients.&nbsp; Now the tide&#x2019;s risen and swallowed all but one of the Squire Point rocks.&nbsp; Now a pelagic cormorant and three glaucous-winged gulls cluster on that shrinking, kelp-skirted surface.&nbsp; A front&#x2019;s pulled a gray blanket over the Sound.&nbsp; I scan with binoculars the choppy water in front of familiar landmarks &#x2013; Pleiades, Icy Bay, Iktua Passage, Brandt Island, Labyrinth &#x2013; for a black fin that might, at any moment, appear amid those waves.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><h2>Justify: 111 Days to Triple Crown Glory</h2><p>With a trademark powerful stride amid a blaze of red and yellow silks, Justify emphatically crossed the finish line at the 2018 Belmont Stakes and became just the 13th winner of horse racing's elusive Triple Crown.

As he did so masterfully in <i>Prime Obsession</i>, Derbyshire brings the evolution of mathematical thinking to dramatic life by focusing on the key historical players. <i>Unknown Quantity</i> begins in the time of Abraham and Isaac and moves from Abel's proof to the higher levels of abstraction developed by Galois through modern-day advances. Derbyshire explains how a simple turn of thought from "this plus this equals this" to "this plus <i>what</i> equals this?" gave birth to a whole new way of perceiving the world. With a historian's narrative authority and a beloved teacher's clarity and passion, Derbyshire leads readers on an intellectually satisfying and pleasantly challenging historical and mathematical journey.</p><p>John Derbyshire is a mathematician and linguist by education, a systems analyst by profession, and a celebrated writer in his spare time. His work appears frequently in <b>National Review</b> and <b>The New Criterion</b>. Born and raised in England, he has made his home in the United States for the past fifteen years.This book's title is deceiving, for Derbyshire offers a very real and very entertaining survey of the development of algebra. "Real" and "imaginary" refer to types of numbers, and Derbyshire (<i>Prime Obsession</i>) opens with a basic primer on the various flavors of numbers and polynomials before looking at algebra's development over 3,000 years. As he explains how algebraic notation wended its way from Sumerian scratches on clay to such contemporary mathematical structures as Calabi-Yau manifolds (used by Andrew Wiles to solve Fermat's Last Theorem), Derbyshire introduces readers to the colorful figures who made contributions: Hypatia, whose death in Alexandria at the hands of an angry Christian mob marked the end of mathematics in the ancient world; 19th-century mathematician Hermann Grassmann, who published a 3,000-page translation of the ancient Hindu text the Rig Veda after his work on vector spaces was ignored; and Emanuel Lasker, more famous as the longest-reigning world chess champion than for his contributions to ring theory. This book will appeal to readers who relished the rigorous mathematical discursions interspersed with informal historical vignettes of David Berlinski's <i>A Tour of the Calculus</i>, but less mathematically inclined readers more interested in the history of science will also enjoy it. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He leaves behind a chilling cryptic message...&#x201c;<i>This is where it begins.</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Miles away, an alarmed mother receives an unsettling letter from her estranged husband, stained with bloody fingerprints.<br> &nbsp;<br> And all across California, children are becoming affected by a monstrous change&#x2014;and their parents, by a mounting fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Social worker Carrie Daniels and reporter Brian Howells are determined to find the link between these baffling crimes. But they shouldn&#x2019;t look too deeply into the lives of the victims. It&#x2019;s quite dark there. And God help them, they won&#x2019;t like what they find.</p><p><b>Bentley Little</b>&nbsp;is the author of numerous novels, short stories, articles, essays, and reviews. After earning a BA in communications and an MA in English, Little sold his soul and abandoned all artistic integrity, working for eight years as a bureaucrat for a midsized city in Orange County, California. His first novel,&nbsp;<i>The Revelation</i>, won the 1990 Horror Writers Association Bram Stoker Award for best first novel.Those with weak stomachs will want to skip Little's latest shocker (after <i>The Burning</i>), which dishes out blood, bowels, mutilation and rape with an unsettling knack for the truly repulsive. Parallel stories revolve around several bloody episodes in which previously respectable California businessmen turn into raving killers, torturing and slaughtering their families. Heroes Brian Howells, a journalist investigating a blood-stained letter from his estranged father, and Carrie Daniels, a social worker looking into a series of beastly birth defects, team up to find out what's behind it all. As Brian and Carrie unearth the secrets of families and friends, flashbacks tell the story of a 19th-century would-be gold prospector who discovers primordial, succubuslike beings swarming the Californian backwoods, beings that now stalk a present-day family on vacation. Little's swift prose jumps from one gut-twister to the next, providing an engrossing if familiar romp that ends in a messy Lovecraftian climax, which may prove too absurd for some readers to swallow. Despite shortcomings, Little again displays, with a plethora of gore and perversion, his robust ability to disgust (and delight) even the most seasoned horror enthusiast. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When a young white prisoner accused of child molesting is thrown into the cell block by a guard who says he belongs in Sing Sing because "the men up there konw what to do with degenerates like you," the stage is set for an explosive series of events; for, among prisoners, this child molester called "short eyes" is the lowest of criminals.</p></p><p><p><b>Miguel Pinero</b>, once a burglar, mugger, shoplifter, and drug addict, began writing when serving a five-year sentence in Sing Sing for armed robbery.

Representing a notable achievement from a great age of floral painting and the engraver's art, they reach across the centuries to us with undiminished freshness and appeal, revealing the most delicate nuances of natural forms with a scientist's eye for precise detail.<br>These fine works represent not only a high point in the history of botanical and zoological art but also an important advance in scientific knowledge as well. The artist, Maria Sibylla Merian (1647&#x2013;1717), was one of the first observers to comprehend and record the metamorphoses of insects, most notably the emergence of the butterfly from its caterpillar and chrysalis phases. Her <i>Erucarum Ortus,</i> whose engravings were originally published in the years 1679&#x2013;1717, was a substantial contribution to the science of entomology and helped lay the foundations for Charles Linnaeus's later work in the classification of plant and animal species.<br>This edition combines all 154 original engravings from her three-volume work on the insects of Europe. Students and lovers of the natural sciences as well as those of the arts and crafts will find these dazzling works a rich source of information and delight. Graphic artists, textile designers, and others will find it a versatile and royalty-free design resource that will earn a treasured place on their library shelves.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Insect Life (Yesterday&#39;s Classics) (Eyes and No Eyes Series)</h2><p>Sixth volume in the &#34;Eyes and No Eyes&#34; series, introduces children to insect life by collecting a variety of specimens and then examining them in detail, identifying their parts and observing their life cycles. Includes caterpillars, familiar moths and butterflies, harmful and useful beetles, wasps and bees, flies, ants, and crickets and grasshoppers. Eight color illustrations and numerous black and white drawings complement the text. Suitable for ages 8 and up.</p><p>Arabella B. Buckley (1840-1929), also known as Mrs. Fisher, was a writer and science educator. She was born in Brighton, England. At 24 she went to work as secretary to Charles Lyell, and worked for him until his death in 1875. Then she began lecturing and writing on science. She married at the age of 44, but continued publishing under her maiden name. Her books include The Fairy-Land of Science (1879), Life and Her Children (1880), Winners in Life&#39;s Race (1883), Insect Life (1901), By Pond and River (1901), Birds of the Air (1901), Wild Life in Woods and Fields (1901), Trees and Shrubs (1901) and Plant Life in Field and Garden (1901).</p><h2>The Man in the Glass House: Philip Johnson, Architect of the Modern Century</h2><p><b>A "smoothly written and fair-minded" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>) biography of architect Philip Johnson--a finalist for the National Book Critic's Circle Award</b> <br>When Philip Johnson died in 2005 at the age of 98, he was still one of the most recognizable--and influential--figures on the American cultural landscape. The first recipient of the Pritzker Prize and MoMA's founding architectural curator, Johnson made his mark as one of America's leading architects with his famous Glass House in New Caanan, CT, and his controversial AT&amp;T Building in NYC, among many others in nearly every city in the country--but his most natural role was as a consummate power broker and shaper of public opinion.<br>Johnson introduced European modernism--the sleek, glass-and-steel architecture that now dominates our cities--to America, and mentored generations of architects, designers, and artists to follow. He defined the era of "starchitecture" with its flamboyant buildings and celebrity designers who esteemed aesthetics and style above all other concerns. But Johnson was also a man of deep paradoxes: he was a Nazi sympathizer, a designer of synagogues, an enfant terrible into his old age, a populist, and a snob. His clients ranged from the Rockefellers to televangelists to Donald Trump.<br>Award-winning architectural critic and biographer Mark Lamster's <i>The Man in the Glass House </i>lifts the veil on Johnson's controversial and endlessly contradictory life to tell the story of a charming yet deeply flawed man. A rollercoaster tale of the perils of wealth, privilege, and ambition, this book probes the dynamics of American culture that made him so powerful, and tells the story of the built environment in modern America.</p><p><b>Mark Lamster</b> is the architecture critic of the <i>Dallas Morning News</i>, a professor in the architecture school at the University of Texas at Arlington, and a 2017 Loeb Fellow of the Harvard Graduate School of Design.<b>One of the Best Books of the Year - <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i></b><br><br>"Smoothly written and fair-minded...

It's clear that Johnson was a fascinating and disturbing figure; Lamster's biography, impressively and honestly, displays him with his full complexity."&#x2015;<b><i>Ruth Franklin, author of <i>Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life</i></i></b><br><br>"More than a dozen years after his death Philip Johnson remains a perplexing, polarizing, magnetic and frustrating figure: although he was far from our greatest architect, no one did more to shape our architectural culture. In this compelling biography, Mark Lamster deconstructs Johnson's complex persona, evaluates his work and begins the complex process of establishing his place in history."&#x2015;<b><i>Paul Goldberger, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic and author of <i>Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry</i></i></b><br><br>"Philip Johnson was as complicated and contradictory as the American century that created him and which he helped define. Modernist, reactionary, anti-Semite, populist, artist, and commercial powerhouse, he lived, in some sense, to contradict himself. In Mark Lamster's nuanced telling, Johnson becomes more than the man in the round glasses or the avatar of modernism; he becomes a symbol of America itself.

Faith Ringgold divides her time between New Jersey and Southern California.Kindergarten-Grade 4-A talking bus is literally the vehicle for this picture-book biography. Marcie, on her way to school, finds herself on a driverless bus occupied by a group of unfamiliar passengers who don't seem to notice she's there. A disembodied voice tells her that this used to be the Cleveland Avenue bus but is now the Rosa Parks bus, and then launches into an account of the woman's life. Ringgold recounts the dramatic events triggered by Parks's refusal to give up her seat: the Montgomery bus boycott; the leadership, persecution, and death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; the Supreme Court decision to ban bus segregation; and public recognition of the woman who started it all. The story ends when Parks herself enters the bus for a birthday celebration with the passengers who are now revealed as personages from her history. While the artifice of the talking bus and a few minor lapses in logic sometimes detract from a solid telling, the story does much to humanize a larger-than-life figure. Ringgold's colorful, textured acrylic-on-canvas paper paintings done in a na?f style are a perfect complement to the stark realism of the events and the simple dignity of the subject. Color and line are used to suggest ideas, such as the turbulent purple, black, blue, and chalky white and the jagged forms depicting the Ku Klux Klan and bombings. Text and art harmonize, with print changing from black to white and appearing on each page in an interesting variety of layouts. An accessible telling and beautiful illustrations result in a worthy contribution to this developing genre.<br><i>Marie Orlando, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>When Momma Speaks: The Bible and Motherhood from a Womanist Perspecitive</h2><p><p>Stephanie Buckhanon Crowder provides an engaging womanist reading of mother characters in the Old and New Testaments. After providing a brief history of womanist biblical interpretation, she shows how the stories of several biblical mothers&#x2014;Hagar, Rizpah, Bathsheba, Mary, the Canaanite woman, and Zebedee's wife&#x2014;can be powerful sources for critical reflection, identification, and empowerment.

Crowder lifts up and reflects on the lived experiences of African American women with integrity, honesty, wholeness, and deep beauty. An African American woman's experience has always been more socially, financially, culturally, and biblically complicated than traditional discourse has allowed. <i>When Momma Speaks</i> gives voice and texture to those complexities in ways women of color can embrace and celebrate."<br>--Charisse L. Gillett, President, Lexington Theological Seminary</p><br><br><p>"Through Crowder's illuminating perspective, biblical mothers from Hagar to Mary, Rizpah to Bathsheba come to new life.

She weaves the narratives of mothers from the Bible into our present-day contexts to help us think critically about what it means to be a black mother in today's world. Crowder opens the door of womanist maternal thought for scholars, pastors, and laypeople alike to enter into an emergent school of thought and depart with new and transforming insights for the academy, church, and home.

Every time someone looks at me for a beat too long. Every time a message arrives in my inbox. Every time the phone displays a number I don&#x2019;t know. For a second or two, I fool myself into believing.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s hard to remember someone when you don&#x2019;t know what they look like. Because A changes from day to day, it&#x2019;s impossible to choose a memory and have it mean more than that single day. No matter how I picture A, it&#x2019;s not going to be what A looks like now. I remember A as a boy and as a girl, as tall and short, skin and hair all different colors. A blur. But the blur takes the shape of how A made me feel, and that may be the most accurate shape of all.<br> &nbsp;<br> A has been gone a month. I should be used to it. But how can there be any separation when A is in so many of my thoughts? Isn&#x2019;t that as close as you can get to another person, to have them constantly inside your head?<br> &nbsp;<br> As I&#x2019;m thinking all these things, feeling all these things, I can&#x2019;t let any of them show. Look at me and you will see: A girl who has finally buried the remains of her last bad relationship. A girl with a great new boyfriend. A girl with friends who support her and a family that isn&#x2019;t more annoying than any other family. You will not see anything missing--you will not sense the part of her that&#x2019;s been left inside someone else. Maybe if you look into her eyes long enough and know what to look for. But the point is: The person who knew how to look at me like that is gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> My boyfriend, Alexander, knows there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;m not telling him, but he&#x2019;s not the kind of guy who wants to know everything. He gives me space. He tells me it&#x2019;s fine to take things slow. I can tell that he&#x2019;s fallen for me, that he really wants this to work. I want it to work, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I also want A.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even if we can&#x2019;t be together. Even if we&#x2019;re no longer near each other. Even if all I get is a hello, and not even a how are you?--I want to know where A is, and that A thinks of me at least some of the time. Even if it means nothing now, I want to know it meant something once.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The doorbell rings. I am the only one home. My thoughts race to A--I allow myself to picture the stranger at the door who isn&#x2019;t really a stranger. I imagine the light in his eyes, or maybe her eyes. I imagine A saying a solution has been found, a way has been devised to stay in the same body for longer than a single day without hurting anyone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; I yell out. I&#x2019;m stupidly nervous as I get to the door and throw it open.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy I find there is familiar, but at first I don&#x2019;t recognize him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you Rhiannon?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I nod, I&#x2019;m realizing who he is.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nathan?&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now he&#x2019;s surprised, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know you, don&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; he asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> I answer honestly. &#x201c;It depends on what you remember.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I know this is dangerous ground. Nathan is not supposed to remember the day that A was in his body, borrowing his life. He is not supposed to remember the way he and I danced in a basement, or anything that happened after.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was your name,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I kept thinking your name. Like when you wake up from a dream and there&#x2019;s only one part you can remember? That&#x2019;s what your name was. So I went online and checked out all the Rhiannons who live near me. When I saw your picture . . . I felt like I&#x2019;d seen you before. But I couldn&#x2019;t remember where or when.&#x201d; His hands are starting to shake. &#x201c;What happened? If you have any idea what I&#x2019;m talking about, can you please tell me what happened? I only have pieces. . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> What kind of rational person would ever believe the truth? Who wouldn&#x2019;t laugh when someone tells them it&#x2019;s possible to move from one body to another? That&#x2019;s how I reacted at first.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only reason I stopped being rational was because something irrational happened to me. And I knew it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I can see that Nathan knows it, too. Still, I warn him, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to believe me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be amazed at what I can believe at this point,&#x201d; he replies.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know I need to be careful. I know there&#x2019;s no going back once the story is out. I know he might not be trustworthy.<br> &nbsp;<br> But A is gone. A can&#x2019;t be hurt by this. And I . . . I need to tell someone. I need to share this with someone who at least partly deserves to hear it.<br> &nbsp;<br> So I let Nathan in. I sit him down.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tell him as much of the truth as I can.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Healing Your Eyes with Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture, Acupressure, &amp; Chinese Herbs</h2><p>For the past ten years, Andy Rosenfarb has successfully used acupuncture and Chinese medicine to treat a wide range of eye conditions.

In the championship game for the NCAA title that year, Don Haskins, coach of the then little-known Texas Western College, did something that had never been done before in the history of college basketball. He started five black players, and in the now legendary game, unseated the nationally top-ranked University of Kentucky. Broadcast on television throughout the country, the Miners victory became the impetus for the desegregation of all college teams in the South during the next few years.<br><br>Now, for the first time, Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins tell his story. Beginning as a small-town high school basketball coach, Haskins was known for his tough coaching methods and larger-than-life personality. As a child growing up during the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma, he developed a strong set of values and discipline that he would instill in his players throughout his coaching career. With recollections from his former players, including those of the 1966 team, along with Haskins's own Seven Principles for Success, <em>Glory Road</em> is the inspiring story of a living legend and one of the most respected coaches of all time.<br><br>With a foreword by basketball legend Bobby Knight, and coinciding with the release of the film <em>Glory Road</em>, the story of Don Haskins and his championship team is sure to become a classic for sports fans and historians.</p><p><strong>Don Haskins</strong> was the head coach at Texas Western College (later renamed the University of Texas, El Paso), where he won 719 games, 14 Western Athletic Conference championships, and the 1966 national championship. He is a member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and lives in El Paso with his wife, Mary.<br><br> <strong>Dan Wetzel</strong> is the award-winning national columnist for Yahoo! Sports and the coauthor of the critically acclaimed books <em>Sole Influence</em> and <em>Runnin' Rebel</em>. He lives in Berkley, Michigan, with his wife, Jan, and daughter, Allie.*Starred Review* Don Haskins was 34 years old when he coached the Texas Western Miners to the NCAA basketball championship in a game that most sports historians agree fundamentally altered college athletics. Haskins' starters and top-two reserves were black--the first time in history that had happened. The Miners defeated all-white Kentucky and its legendarily racist coach, Adolph Rupp, in the finals. In this mesmerizing autobiography, Haskins rejects such labels as trailblazer or social pioneer. He says instead he was simply an obsessed coach who recruited the best players he could get--despite unofficial quotas on black players--and drove them mercilessly. He also says that his university--now known as the University of Texas at El Paso--had integrated its basketball team almost a decade earlier, and the ethnic diversity of the town mitigated most of the racial tension one might have expected in another setting. That's not to say that he and his players didn't undergo plenty of trials. The author's modesty aside, what makes this book such compelling reading is that Haskins is a one-of-a-kind character--a man who chose never to leave his relatively obscure post, preferring smoky small-town Texas cantinas to, well, just about anyplace. There will be a major film this winter based on Texas Western's 1966 season, so expect significant demand for Haskins' book. But no matter the quality of the movie, this is one of the best sports autobiographies in many years. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The first spread shows the barnyard from outside the fence, with all the animals that live inside. Then, the pigs, donkey, ducks, and geese and others all introduce themselves through a lively, rhyming, first-person verse and an illustration full of movement and color. The visit ends as night falls, but not before readers meet the nighttime animals. A final two-page spread takes children back outside the fence as the rural denizens go to sleep and the fox sneaks off to hunt prey. Sound words are scattered on some of the pages, a device that might prove somewhat confusing to very young listeners. "Wag! Wag!" appears next to the dog's tail, rather than the sound the animal makes. "Wriggle" and "snuffle" appear for the pigs even though every three-year-old knows a pig says, "oink." And geese are supposed to "honk," not "cackle" or "squawk." Still, these are minor flaws that do not overwhelm the book's many virtues. It has a lively read-aloud text and the clearly drawn, easily identified animals are filled with personality.<br><i>Jane Marino, Scarsdale Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Past Lives, Future Healing: A Psychic Reveals the Secrets to Good Health and Great Relationships</h2><p>The one expert millions of readers have learned to trust, one of the few psychics instantly recognizable to television viewers, Sylvia Browne is back. She has proven herself, in her fifty years of working as a medium, to be the reigning queen of psychic phenomena. Here is an insightful look at how much of one&#39;s present life is informed by one&#39;s past lives, and how many health and relationship problems have their roots in unresolved past lives. From unexplained illnesses to bizarre phobias, from irrational anxieties and fears to the choice of partners, each can be traced back to past lives. Even birthmarks and recurring dreams are signs of issues from past lives. Sylvia helps readers recognize where their deep-rooted problems, fears, and hang-ups all began-and how to ultimately resolve them.</p><p>You've got to hand it to the renowned celebrity psychic Sylvia Browne--she gives it straight from the gut and really doesn't give a hoot whether you believe her. As a result, it's hard to not be captivated and convinced by her firm belief in the afterlife, or in this case, the <i>before</i>life. Her writing is most riveting when she uses her storytelling voice, relating dialogue from client sessions that include past-life stories. In fact, she opens the book with a scene in which she follows the small clues offered by an agoraphobic to help him reveal that a past-life poisoning (when he was an Aztec ruler) had been crippling his present life. Throughout the book, Brown continues to use real-life client stories to show how past-life baggage can weigh down a present life. The final chapters offer how-to lessons on conducting your own past-life regression and healing sessions. Be warned: Browne's writing sometimes sounds like the channeled writing that was popular in the late 1980's: "The miraculous gift of eternity means that the singular essence that is you will always, always exist." But readers may forgive her these lapses, as she clearly writes from heartfelt convictions rather than a stylized formula. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>her Side and Back and <i>Life on the Other Side </i>were phenomenal #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers.

But there is something greater, something that we all share, indeed something that we all <i>are</i>, that can alleviate that pain: it is the formless presence&#x2014;the loving, boundless awareness&#x2014;at the heart of all experience. This book cuts through the esotericism surrounding spiritual awakening to help you realize your true nature and show you how to integrate that realization into everyday life.</p><p>In life, there is turmoil and inevitable pain. There is war, hunger, failure, heartbreak, and trauma. We struggle in relationships and with our attachments, thoughts, feelings, and memories, trapped in the prison of psychological self-consciousness. Most of us have been conditioned to believe that we are all separate individuals to whom uncomfortable or upsetting things happen. We feel alone and isolated from the world, and convince ourselves that the beauty, truth, and goodness we long for are out of our reach. Really, it&#x2019;s this imaginary division that causes us to suffer.</p><p><i>Boundless Awareness</i> seeks to relieve this suffering by drawing attention to the beautiful, encompassing, cohesive nature of awareness itself, as found in your direct experience. Using practical, contemplative exercises and brief meditations, the author guides you along a broad path of spiritual awakening, deconstructing your delusions of self and separation and integrating a concept of existence that is free from the suffering of individual selfhood, but which acknowledges the attachments, traumatic experiences, and emotional pain of being human.</p><p>With this book, you&#x2019;ll come to realize your innate perfection as the uncreated light of boundless awareness, and soften into the open, spacious, and unconditionally loving essence of existence. You&#x2019;ll gain a deeper understanding of pain and attachments, and learn to meet these experiences with a new resilience. Most importantly, you&#x2019;ll find guidance on how to embody and express this awakening as love, joy, service, and creativity in your daily life.</p></p><p><b>Michael A.

If you could design a God, what would He, She, or It be like? And how will you fare on the tricky terrain of ethics when your taboos are under the spotlight? <br><br><i> Do You Think What You Think You Think </i>features a&nbsp;dozen philosophical quizzes guaranteed to make armchair philosophers uncomfortably shift in their seats. Fun, challenging, and surprising, this book will enable you to discover the <i>you</i> you never knew you were.</p><p><b>Julian Baggini </b>is the editor of <i>The Philosopher&#x2019;s Magazine</i>.<br><br><b>Jeremy Stangroom&nbsp;</b>is an elected Fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion. He is a cofounder of&nbsp;<i>The Philosophers&#x2019; Magazine</i>&nbsp;and its New Media editor. He lives in Toronto, Ontario.In their latest philosophical novelty book, Baggini and Stangroom refashion the kind of frivolous quiz found in women's and men's style magazines&#x2014;the kind with flippant multiple-choice answers adding up to a final score&#x2014;as a philosophical tool. The challenges are amusing and fun enough to pass the time during a long commute, making for a kind of Philosophy 101 student's sudoku, but not much more. As in his previous book, <i>The Pig That Wants to Be Eaten</i>, Baggini encourages people to question common assumptions. Unfortunately, this book feels more superficial than its charming precursor. In the case of a quiz on free will, the scoring requires more time than the test taking. In another chapter, it's possible to conclude that Britney Spears is as great an artist as Mozart. The book's final measures the reader's absorption of the history of the discipline that's provided in the overviews and analyses surrounding each of the tests&#x2014;but it's clear that learning the history of philosophy isn't the point. Once readers have completed the final tally, some may be disappointed to find that, no matter what their score, what you know about philosophy isn't worth knowing. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ever since, she's been haunted by surreal dreams and an urgent sense that she's forgotten something important. One night, she gets a mysterious call from Oliver, who knows more about her than he should and claims he can help her remember. She accepts his help, even as she questions his motives and fights a strange attraction to him. In order to find Theo and piece together that lost day in September, Astrid must navigate a maze of eccentric Boston nightlife, from the seedy corners of Chinatown to a drug-fueled Alice-in-Wonderland-themed party to a club where everyone dresses like the dead. In between headaches and nightmares, she struggles to differentiate between memory, fantasy, and reality, and starts to wonder if Theo really exists. Eventually, she'll need to choose between continuing her search for him or following her growing feelings for Oliver. Astrid might go to extreme lengths to find what she's lost... or might lose even more in her pursuit to remember (like her sanity).</p><p>Margarita Montimore received a BFA in Creative Writing from Emerson College.

Growing up, he witnessed his family being crushed by the weight of poverty and racism, and escaped to Atlanta to answer the calling to become a preacher. Before engaging in acts of political dissent or preaching at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he would remain for more than four decades, King, Sr., earned high school and college diplomas while working double shifts as a truck driver&#x2014;and he won the heart of his future wife, Alberta &#x201c;Bunch&#x201d; Williams.<br><br>King, Sr., recalls the struggles and joys of his journey: the pain of leaving his parents and seven siblings on the family farm; the triumph of winning voting rights for blacks in Atlanta; and the feelings of fatherly pride and anxiety as he watched his son put his life in danger at the forefront of the civil rights movement.

It is a gathering of poems that demonstrate what happens when writers in a marginalized community collectively turn from dedicating their writing to political, social, and economic struggles, and instead devote themselves to the art of their poems and to the ideas they embody. These poets bear witness to the interior landscapes of their own individual selves or examine the private or personal worlds of invented personae and, therefore, of human beings living in our modern and postmodern worlds.<br><br> The anthology focuses on post-1960s poetry and includes such poets as Rita Dove, Ai, Nathaniel Mackey, Natasha Trethewey, Kevin Young, Terrence Hayes, Elizabeth Alexander, Major Jackson, Carl Phillips, Harryette Mullen, and Yusef Komunyakaa&#x2015;artists who, using a wide range of styles and forms, are cultivating a poetry of personal voice and interiority that speaks against the backdrop of community and anscestry.</p><p>Charles Henry Rowell is the founder and editor of the premier literary and cultural journal of the African diaspora, Callaloo. He is a professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, where he lives.This spirited and substantial anthology confirms an inadequately appreciated literary phenomenon: African American poetry is flourishing. As Rowell asserts in his informative opening commentary, there is profound depth, imagination, hard truths, beauty, a vital spectrum of feelings, and &#x201c;linguistic energy and agility&#x201d; to be found in the work of the 86 distinct, groundbreaking poets showcased here. Organized chronologically, the collection begins with such &#x201c;precursors&#x201d; as Gwendolyn Brooks and Robert Hayden, black arts movement poets, including Nikki Giovanni and Haki Madhubuti, and such pillars as Lucille Clifton, June Jordan, and Yusef Komunyakaa. Rowell then rolls out the &#x201c;Heirs&#x201d; in three successive waves of poets writing in the 1980s up to the present, netting such stars as Elizabeth Alexander, Kevin Young, Natasha Trethewey, and Terrance Hayes along with incandescent emerging writers. Illuminating poet statements enhance the resonance of this magnificent gathering of poems subtle and declarative, intense and mischievous in their response to questions of inheritance and independence, community and self, life bitter and sweet.

Smith writes, &#x201c;each word is a wish.&#x201d; --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Goosebumps HorrorLand #5: Dr. Maniac vs. Robby Schwartz</h2><p>It's a whole new ride from master of horror and bestselling author R.L.

Born in the French Quarter in 1920, Anatole had begun to conceal his racial identity after his family moved to Brooklyn and his parents resorted to "passing" in order to get work. As he grew older and entered the ranks of the New York literary elite, he maintained the fa�ade. <br>Now his daughter Bliss tries to make sense of his choices. Seeking out unknown relatives in New York, Los Angeles, and New Orleans, Bliss uncovers the 250-year history of her family in America and chronicles her own evolution from privilged WASP to a woman of mixed-race ancestry.<br></p><p>Bliss Broyard is the author of the collection of stories, <em>My Father, Dancing</em>, which was a New York Times Notable Book of the year.

She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and daughter.Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley<p>For most of the 1970s and '80s, Anatole Broyard was a staff book critic for the New York Times, writing two or three reviews a week for its daily pages, as opposed to its Sunday book section. My own career in that same line of work was just getting under way, and I paid close attention to what he was doing. He obviously was intelligent and erudite, but I sometimes felt that he was more interested in showing his technical skills than in giving books deep, fair readings. Still, he enjoyed considerable influence and was widely known in literary circles.</p><p>Broyard died in October 1990 after a long, painful and debilitating struggle against cancer, but continuing interest in him was insured by the disclosure that he was, as his wife told their two adult children, "part black." According to Bliss Broyard, "My mother explained that my father had 'mixed blood,' and his parents were both light-skinned Creoles from New Orleans, where race-mixing had been common. She said that his parents had to pass for white in order to get work in 1930s New York, which confused my father about what their family was, or was supposed to be." Broyard's response to this, as he moved from Brooklyn to Greenwich Village and began to live a bohemian life in the postwar years, was to "pass for white." He did so for the rest of his life, though many who knew him were aware, or suspected, that his racial identity was not precisely as he presented it.</p><p>Six years after Broyard's death, the New Yorker published an article by Henry Louis Gates, the well-known professor of African American studies, called "The Passing of Anatole Broyard," which was, predictably, the cause of much heated gossip in literary, journalistic and publishing circles. Now Broyard is back in the news with the appearance of this family history and memoir by his daughter. One Drop, Bliss Broyard tells us, takes its title from "the 'one-drop rule,' which classified as black any Americans with the tiniest fraction -- just one drop -- of 'black blood.' It had grown out of a practice dating back to slavery known as hypodescent, which assigned someone of mixed parentage to the lower-status race, and had become the legal and social custom in the era of legalized 'Jim Crow' segregation." The book is an account of her effort to discover just "how black" her father was and thus, obviously, "how black" she is.</p><p>It's a peculiar book. The author's sincerity and honesty are evident and appealing, and her subject is of continuing interest and importance even now, when an appreciable amount of heat has been drained from our old obsessions and fears about race. The problem is that One Drop is actually at least five books -- her father's story, her own story, her family's story, the story of "passing" and the story of racial identity in the United States -- and its author doesn't do a very good job of weaving them together into a seamless, coherent narrative. For well over 100 pages, she wanders this way and that, telling this story and that, interviewing this person and that, circling around the one story of greatest interest -- her father's -- but never really pouncing on it. Then she takes a detour of nearly 200 pages to explore the Broyard family's history in New Orleans. Not until she gets past page 300 does she finally focus fully on her father, and one can't help wondering how many readers she will have lost by then.</p><p>"My father had left behind so much unfinished business," she writes, and her hope is to wrap it up. This would be a difficult task in any circumstances, but it is all the more so in this case because of the exceedingly complex life, character and legacy of Anatole Broyard. He was by most accounts immensely charming and energetic, positively catnip to women (and quick to take advantage of it). But he was also boastful and vain, as well as an operator who, as one friend told Gates, was "exorbitantly in control" and "fastidious about managing things." Thus it is extremely difficult, for example, to figure out why he chose to pass for white, or to get much sense of how this choice weighed on him, as anecdotal evidence suggests it did.</p><p>He was born in New Orleans in 1920, into a family that had been there since the early 1750s when Etienne Broyard, "a white man from France . . . landed in the Louisiana Territory." Within a century "the Broyards had begun to be identified in public records as mulatto or free people of color." Bliss Broyard's research has convinced her that "the moment of mixing in the Broyard family" occurred in 1855, when her great-great-grandfather married a free woman of color. Her account of how subsequent generations of the family dealt with (or ignored) this legacy is interesting, but she insists on larding it up with a boilerplate history of American laws, controversies and customs regarding race. By her own honest admission she knew almost nothing about race in America until her father's secret was revealed, and to her credit she studied it closely; it really was not necessary, though, to regurgitate so much of what she learned -- most of which will be familiar to many readers -- in this book, which is too long by about 150 pages.</p><p>It's also unfortunate that she spends so much time fretting about her racial identity. The notion of crossing "from white to the other side" clearly has some appeal for her, and when her New Orleans relatives call her "pure white," she is uncomfortable, yet she just can't let go: "It had been nearly a decade since my father had died, since I'd learned of his -- and my -- African ancestry, since I'd begun reading and learning and talking about race. And despite my glimmerings of double consciousness, I didn't yet feel black. I was still waiting for an 'Aha!' moment, an affirmation of this identity down deep in my bones." Fortunately, within just a few pages of this unbearably PC declaration, Broyard admits that "the thought of how blinded I'd been in my obsession to find a slave ancestor made me feel sick with shame," which redeems her, as does this: "I hated the image of myself in [a black acquaintance's] eyes -- a silly white girl making a big fuss over nothing. I hated how uncertain I became when trying to locate myself on this racial landscape or even recognize its terrain. Torn between trying to pinpoint the boundaries between black and white and an urge to deny their existence at all, I was caught in a dialectical tug-of-war. The futility of my efforts reminded me of a skit I once saw in which a man kept moving a wooden chair around an empty white room, unable to find a spot that suited him, despite their being all the same."</p><p>As she seems finally to have understood, the whole notion of race is fraught with ambiguity. I won't reveal the results of the DNA tests she finally had done, but what they proved more than anything else is that racial identity is a complete mare's nest. In issues of race as in so many others, "Know thyself" is an injunction almost impossible to obey. Notions of racial purity are as false as notions of racial impurity; there's no such thing, though much of human history has been frittered away by people trying to legitimize race as the defining element in what passes for civilization.</p><p>Still, it's not really surprising that Anatole Broyard chose to live as he did. He didn't look in the least bit "black," and he wanted to enter the world of literature, which in the 1940s and '50s in this country was patently "white." He placed personal ambition ahead of racial identity or racial solidarity or whatever one cares to call it, and his daughter makes a pretty solid argument for him: "My father truly believed that there wasn't any essential difference between blacks and whites and that the only person responsible for who he was supposed to be was himself." To be sure, a black friend had a point when he "sniped that my dad was black when he entered the subway in Brooklyn and white when he got out at West Fourth Street in Manhattan," but that's the choice he made, and he managed to live with it.</p><p>His daughter asks: "Was my father's choice rooted in self-preservation or in self-hatred? Did it strike a blow for individualism or for discrimination? Was he a hero or a cad?" Those are good questions, and as Bliss Broyard well understands, they can never be definitively answered, though my own hunch is that "All of the above" gets somewhere close to the truth.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

As he steered his horse around the hobbling figure he saw that the blobs of red had a regular shape and pattern, like waves. He reined up until the soldier was limping beside him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where did you get that?&#x201d; Porto asked. &#x201c;That scarf?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The soldier, thin and several years younger than Porto, only stared up at him and shook his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I asked you a question. Where did you get it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My mother wove it for me. Piss off.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Porto settled back in his saddle, amused. &#x201c;Are you really a Harborsider, or is your mother a bit blind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The younger soldier looked up at him with a blend of confusion and irritation: he thought he was being insulted but wasn&#x2019;t sure. &#x201c;What do you know about it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;More than you do, as it turns out, because I&#x2019;m from the Rocks and we&#x2019;ve been drubbing you lot at town-ball for centuries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a Shoro&#x2014;a Geyser?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re a Dogfish, dim as can be. What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The young foot soldier looked him over carefully. The two waterfront neighborhoods&#x2014;<i>setros</i>, as they were called in Ansis Pelipp�, the largest city on Perdruin&#x2014;were ancient rivals, and even here, hundreds of leagues north of that island&#x2019;s shores, it was obvious that his first impulse was to brace for a beating. &#x201c;Tell me yours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man on the horse laughed. &#x201c;Porto of Shoro Bay. Owner of one horse and most of a suit of armor. And you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Endri. Baker&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At last, and as if he had been holding it back, the youth smiled. He still had most of his teeth and it made him seem even younger, like one of the boys who had run beside Porto&#x2019;s horse waving and shouting as he made his way through Nabban, all those months ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the love of Usires, you&#x2019;re a tall one, aren&#x2019;t you!&#x201d; Endri looked him up and down. &#x201c;What are you doing so far away from home, my lord?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No lord, me, just a man lucky enough to have a horse. And you&#x2019;re freezing to death because you can&#x2019;t walk fast enough. What happened to your foot?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The younger soldier shrugged. &#x201c;Horse stepped on it. Not your horse. I don&#x2019;t think it was, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d have remembered you, with your Harborside scarf.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wish I had another. I&#x2019;d even wear one in damned Shoro blue. It&#x2019;s so bloody cold here I&#x2019;m dying. Are we in Rimmersgard yet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Crossed the border two days back. But they all live like mountain trolls up here. Houses built of snow and nothing to eat but pine needles. Climb up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Climb up. First time I ever helped a Dogfish, but you won&#x2019;t even make it to the border fort like that. Here, take my hand and I&#x2019;ll pull you up to the saddle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Endri had settled behind him, Porto gave him a sip from his drinking horn. &#x201c;It was terrible, by the way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What was terrible?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The beating we gave you lot this year on St. Tunato&#x2019;s Day. Your Dogfish were weeping in the streets like women.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Liar. Nobody wept.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only because they were too busy begging for mercy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know what my father always says? &#x2018;Go to the palace for justice, go to the church for mercy, but go to the Rocks for liars and thieves.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Porto laughed. &#x201c;For a sniveling Harborsider, your father is a wise man.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;This is a true story, if words can be true. If not, then these are only words.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;Once upon the past, during the preserve of the queen&#x2019;s sixteenth High Celebrant, in the era of the Wars of Return, our people, the Cloud Children, were defeated by a coalition of mortals and the Zida&#x2019;ya, our own treacherous kin, at the Battle for Asu&#x2019;a. The Storm King Ineluki returned to death, his plans in ruins. Our great Queen Utuk&#x2019;ku survived, but fell into the keta-yi&#x2019;indra, a healing sleep nearly as profound as death. It seemed to some of our people that the end of all stories had arrived, that the Great Song itself was coming to an end so that the universe could take its next age-long breath.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;Many, many of our folk who had fought for their queen in a losing cause now departed from the southern lands with thought only of returning to their home in the north ahead of the vengeance of the mortals, who would not be content with their victory, but would strive to overthrow our mountain home and extinguish the last of the Cloud Children.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;This was the moment when the People were nearly destroyed. But it was also a moment of extraordinary grace, of courage beyond the proudest demands we make upon ourselves. And as things have always been in the song of the People, in this, too, even the moments of greatest beauty were perfumed with destruction and loss.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Thus it was for many warriors of the Order of Sacrifice when the Storm King fell, as well as those of other orders who had accompanied them to the enemy&#x2019;s lands. The war was ended. Home was far. And the mortals were close behind, vermin from the filthiest streets of their cities, mercenaries and madmen who killed, not as we do, regretfully, but for the sheer, savage joy of killing.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Lady Miga seyt-Jinnata of the Order of Chroniclers</p><h2>The Last Highlander: Scotland&#x2019;s Most Notorious Clan Chief, Rebel &amp; Double Agent</h2><p><p><b>Saltire First Scottish Book of the Year 2012</b></p><p>Fans of <em>Outlander</em> must read this Saltire Society Literary Awards Scottish First Book of the Year &#x2013; a great non-fiction adventure about Scotland&#x2019;s most notorious clan chief.</p><p>Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, was the last of the great Scottish chiefs &#x2013; and the last nobleman executed for treason.

The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs Shears&#x2019; house. Its eyes were closed. It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not running or asleep. The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. The points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over. I decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because I could not see any other wounds in the dog and I do not think you would stick a garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other reason, like cancer for example, or a road accident.

But it was very difficult to decide which of the diagrams was most like the face they were making because people&#x2019;s faces move very quickly.<br><br>When I told Siobhan that I was doing this, she got out a pencil and another piece of paper and said it probably made people feel very<br><br>[confused face]<br> <br>and then she laughed. So I tore the original piece of paper up and threw it away. And Siobhan apologised. And now if I don&#x2019;t know what someone is saying I ask them what they mean or I walk away.<br><br><b>5<br><br></b>I pulled the fork out of the dog and lifted him into my arms and hugged him. He was leaking blood from the fork-holes.<br><br>I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.<br><br>I had been hugging the dog for 4 minutes when I heard screaming. I looked up and saw Mrs Shears running towards me from the patio. She was wearing pyjamas and a housecoat. Her toenails were painted bright pink and she had no shoes on.<br><br>She was shouting, &#x2018;What in fuck&#x2019;s name have you done to my dog?&#x2019;.<br><br>I do not like people shouting at me. It makes me scared that they are going to hit me or touch me and I do not know what is going to happen.<br><br>&#x2018;Let go of the dog,&#x2019; she shouted. &#x2018;Let go of the fucking dog for Christ&#x2019;s sake.&#x2019;<br><br>I put the dog down on the lawn and moved back 2 metres.<br><br>She bent down. I thought she was going to pick the dog up herself, but she didn&#x2019;t. Perhaps she noticed how much blood there was and didn&#x2019;t want to get dirty. Instead, she started screaming again. <br><br>I put my hands over my ears and closed my eyes and rolled forward till I was hunched up with my forehead pressed onto the grass. The grass was wet and cold. It was nice.<br><br><b>7<br><br></b>This is a murder mystery novel.<br><br>Siobhan said that I should write something I would want to read myself. Mostly I read books about science and maths. I do not like proper novels. In proper novels people say things like, &#x2018;I am veined with iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud. I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus&#x2019; . What does this mean? I do not know. Nor does Father. Nor do Siobhan or Mr Jeavons. I have asked them.<br><br>Siobhan has long blonde hair and wears glasses which are made of green plastic. And Mr Jeavons smells of soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them.<br><br>But I do like murder mystery novels. So I am writing a murder mystery novel. <br><br>In a murder mystery novel someone has to work out who the murderer is and then catch them. It is a puzzle. If it is a good puzzle you can sometimes work out the answer before the end of the book.<br><br>Siobhan said that the book should begin with something to grab people&#x2019;s attention. That is why I started with the dog. I also started with the dog because it happened to me and I find it hard to imagine things which did not happen to me.<br><br>Siobhan read the first page and said that it was different. She put this word into inverted commas by making the wiggly quotation sign with her first and second fingers. She said that it was usually people who were killed in murder mystery novels. I said that two dogs were killed in <b><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i></b>, the hound itself and James Mortimer&#x2019;s spaniel, but Siobhan said they weren&#x2019;t the victims of the murder, Sir Charles Baskerville was. She said that this was because readers cared more about people than dogs, so if a person was killed in the book readers would want to carry on reading. <br><br>I said that I wanted to write about something real and I knew people who had died but I did not know any people who had been killed, except Edward&#x2019;s father from school, Mr Paulson, and that was a gliding accident, not murder, and I didn&#x2019;t really know him. I also said that I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people. Steve, for example, who comes to centre on Thursdays, needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a stick. Siobhan asked me not to say this to Steve&#x2019;s mother.<br><br><b>11<br><br></b>Then the police arrived. I like the police. They have uniforms and numbers and you know what they are meant to be doing. There was a policewoman and a policeman. The policewoman had a little hole in her tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the hole. The policeman had a big orange leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from one side. <br><br>The policewoman put her arms round Mrs Shears and led her back towards the house.<br><br>I lifted my head off the grass. <br><br>The policeman squatted down beside me and said, &#x2018;Would you like to tell me what&#x2019;s going on here, young man?&#x2019;.<br><br>I sat up and said &#x2018;The dog is dead.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;d got that far,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>I said, &#x2018;I think someone killed the dog.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;How old are you?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>I replied, &#x2018;I am 15 years and 3 months and 2 days.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And what, precisely, were you doing in the garden?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>&#x2018;I was holding the dog,&#x2019; I replied.<br><br>&#x2018;And why were you holding the dog?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>This was a difficult question. It was something I wanted to do. I like dogs. It made me sad to see that the dog was dead. <br><br>I like policemen, too, and I wanted to answer the question properly, but the policeman did not give me enough time to work out the correct answer.<br><br>&#x2018;Why were you holding the dog?&#x2019; he asked again.<br><br>&#x2018;I like dogs,&#x2019; I said.<br><br>&#x2018;Did you kill the dog?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>I said, &#x2018;I did not kill the dog.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Is this your fork?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>I said, &#x2018;No.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You seem very upset about this,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>He was asking too many questions and he was asking them too quickly. They were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works. The factory is a bakery and he operates the slicing machines. And sometimes the slicer is not working fast enough but the bread keeps coming and there is a blockage. I sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it.<br><br>The policeman said, &#x2018;I am going to ask you once again...&#x2019;<br><br>I rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead to the ground again and made the noise that Father calls groaning. I make this noise when there is too much information coming into my head from the outside world. It is like when you are upset and you hold the radio against your ear and you tune it halfway between two stations so that all you get is white noise and then you turn the volume right up so that this is all you can hear and then you know you are safe because you cannot hear anything else.<br><br>The policeman took hold of my arm and lifted me onto my feet.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t like him touching me like this.<br><br>And this is when I hit him.<br><br><b>13<br><br></b>This will not be a funny book. I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them. Here is a joke, as an example. It is one of Father&#x2019;s.<br><br><b>His face was drawn but the curtains were real.<br><br></b>I know why this is meant to be funny. I asked. It is because <i>drawn</i> has three meanings, and they are <b>1)</b> drawn with a pencil, <b>2)</b> exhausted, and <b>3)</b> pulled across a window, and meaning <b>1</b> refers to both the face and the curtains, meaning <b>2</b> refers only to the face, and meaning <b>3</b> refers only to the curtains.<br><br>If I try to say the joke to myself, making the word mean the three different things at the same time, it is like hearing three different pieces of music at the same time which is uncomfortable and confusing and not nice like white noise. It is like three people trying to talk to you at the same time about different things.<br><br>And that is why there are no jokes in this book.<br><br><b>17<br><br></b>The policeman looked at me for a while without speaking. Then he said, &#x2018;I am arresting you for assaulting a police officer.&#x2019;<br><br>This made me feel a lot calmer because it is what policeman say on television and in films.<br><br>Then he said, &#x2018;I strongly advise you to get into the back of the police car because if you try any of that monkey-business again, you little shit, I will seriously lose my rag. Is that understood?&#x2019;.<br><br>I walked over to the police car which was parked just outside the gate. He opened the back door and I got inside. He climbed into the driver&#x2019;s seat and made a call on his radio to the policewoman who was still inside the house. He said, &#x2018;The little bugger just had a pop at me, Kate. Can you hang on with Mrs S while I drop him off at the station? I&#x2019;ll get Tony to swing by and pick you up.&#x2019;<br><br>And she said, &#x2018;Sure. I&#x2019;ll catch you later.&#x2019;<br><br>The policeman said, &#x2018;Okey-doke,&#x2019; and we drove off.<br><br>The police car smelt of hot plastic and aftershave and take-away chips.<br><br>I watched the sky as we drove towards the town centre. It was a clear night and you could see the Milky Way. <br><br>Some people think the Milky Way is a long line of stars, but it isn&#x2019;t. Our galaxy is a huge disc of stars millions of light years across and the solar system is somewhere near the outside edge of the disc.<br>When you look in direction A, at 90� to the disc, you don&#x2019;t see many stars. But when you look in direction B, you see lots more stars because you are looking into the main body of the galaxy, and because the galaxy is a disc you see a stripe of stars.<br><br>And then I thought about how, for a long time scientists were puzzled by the fact that the sky is dark at night, even though there are billions of stars in the universe and there must be stars in every direction you look, so that the sky should be full of starlight because there is very little in the way to stop the light reaching earth.<br><br>Then they worked out that the universe was expanding, that the stars were all rushing away from one another after the Big Bang, and the further the stars were away from us the faster they were moving, some of them nearly as fast as the speed of light, which was why their light never reached us.<br><br>I like this fact. It is something you can work out in your own mind just by looking at the sky above your head at night and thinking without having to ask anyone.<br><br>And when the universe has finished exploding all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall towards the centre of the universe again. And then there will be nothing to stop us seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving towards us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling.<br><br>Except that no one will see this because there will be no people left on the earth to see it. They will probably have become extinct by then. And even if there are people still in existence they will not see it because the light will be so bright and hot that everyone will be burnt to death, even if they live in tunnels.<br><br><b>19<br><br></b>Chapters in books are usually given the cardinal numbers <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and so on.

The first time she opened a book on the subject, in 1975, it was to discredit astrology and to prove to an acquaintance that astrology couldn't be believed. However, the first book she opened happened to show a little more than the usual sun sign descriptions and she found enough truth within those pages to convince her that there was indeed something to it. The surprising revelation that the planetary positions at our birth and their movements following birth are somehow synchronized with human events greatly excited her and it wasn't long before she realized she'd found her calling as she delved passionately into the art of astrology as a means by which to learn more about the meaning of life.</p> <p>Her goal is to promote astrology and teach astrologers the most valuable and reliable techniques for interpreting the horoscope.</p> <p>Celeste Teal has continually written for the popular astrology magazines since 1986.

You can find them in the drawer of the end table in your hotel room, under the pews at your local church, on the shelves of your local library or bookstore, posted in full and in multiple versions on any number of websites. You can find them in every corner of the earth, even (if you look carefully enough) in places where they're forbidden. So there's no trouble getting hold of a Bible. But once you have one in your hands . . . now what? The Scriptures tell us that the Word of God is living and active; what happens to us as we interact with it? In <em>The Bible Study Handbook</em> Lindsay Olesberg lays a foundation for why we read the Bible, what attitudes and expectations are most helpful as we enter into serious Bible study, and what methods and practices yield the most fruit. From foundational insights to best practices and hands-on exercises, you will find everything you need in this book to cultivate your curiosity, hone your attention and mine the applicabilities of whatever passage you find yourself in. And you'll be reminded of the insights, encouragement and even transformation waiting for people who commit to studying the Scriptures well together.

We&#x2019;ll discover how that effort then evolved into North Korea&#x2019;s nuclear program and the looming threat it presents to mankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>Japan&#x2019;s WWII development of a nuclear program is not universally known. After decades of research into national intelligence archives both in the US and abroad, Robert Wilcox builds on his earlier accounts and provides the most detailed account available of the creation of Japan&#x2019;s version of our own Manhattan Project&#x2014;from the project&#x2019;s inception before America&#x2019;s entry into WWII, to the possible detonation of a nuclear device in 1945 in present-day North Korea. Wilcox weaves a fascinating portrait of the secret giant industrial complex in northern Korea where Japan&#x2019;s atomic research and testing culminated. And it is there that North Korea, following the Japanese defeat, salvaged what remained of the complex and fashioned its own nuclear program. This program puts not only Japan, but also its allies, including the US, in jeopardy.</p><p>Robert K. Wilcox is an award-winning author, journalist, historian, novelist, and screenwriter. He has authored thousands of published articles, many produced screenplays, and twelve published books&#x2014;many of them translated into foreign editions.

Instructions for how to navigate through each of these layers and how to recognize where we are in our spiritual journey are included each step of the way along with common physical, emotional, and spiritual symptoms that may be experienced. By addressing post-awakening states, oneness, dark nights of the soul, ego death, near-death and severe illness, psychic abilities, addictions, dietary changes, the God self, personal and collective shadow, and psychosis vs. awakening we understand the experiences we may go through while struggling with spiritual awakenings. This practical book opens new understandings of how to live in the world while going through an awakening process, and offers the revolutionary idea that we are meant to be humans, to have a physical body with physical, sensate experiences and emotions. We are meant to live in the world and be a part of it even as fully awakened individuals.

Co. &#34;&#34;Jimmy&#34;&#34; Doolittle&#39;s legendary bombing raid on Tokyo gave America the morale boost it needed in the wake of Pearl Harbor. This is the full story as told by the Doolittle Raiders&#39; official historian. Carroll Glines is also the author of Attack on Yamamoto.</p><p>Glines is curator of the Doolittle Military Aviation Library at the University of Texas.On April 18, 1942, 16 B-25s under the command of Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle were launched from the carrier Hornet , flew 650 miles to Japan, dropped their bombs on Tokyo and other targets, and escaped to China and neutral Soviet territory. Although a very small affair in comparison with the B-29 strikes three years later, the Doolittle raid was a severe psychological blow to Japanese military leaders and had far-reaching strategical effects. At the same time, the raid provided an electrifying boost to American morale. Glines, former editor of Professional Pilot magazine, relates this exciting story in full: the bold conception of the mission, the selection of its leader (Doolittle was known as a "master of the calculated risk"), the difficult preparations, the hair-raising "thirty seconds over Tokyo," and the ordeals of those crewmen who fell into Japanese hands in China. Glines also tells the almost unbelievable story of "the last Doolittle raider." Lt. George Barr, convinced that his liberation was an elaborate Japanese trick, was shunted around the U.S. military-medical circuit and ended up in a mental ward. Doolittle himself, by then a general, traced him, rescued him from bureaucratic oblivion, and set him firmly on the road to recovery.

The <i>Charleston Post and Courier</i> proclaims Elizabeth Peters &#x201c;a mistress of plot,&#x201d; while the <i>New York Times Book Review </i>declares, &#x201c;Amelia remains an irrepressible delight.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Named 1998 Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America, Elizabeth Peters is also a doctor of Egyptology whose mysteries have submerged readers in the vivid turn-of-the-century world of Amelia Peabody. In <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> Peters captures the immediacy of uncovering a new Egyptian tomb within the context of a tightly plotted murder investigation involving the entire Emerson Peabody clan. The characters, including Amelia's husband, Radcliffe Emerson, and her gifted son, Ramses, are meticulously drawn. As in previous novels the dialogue is reminiscent of <i>The Thin Man</i>. When a man calls out to passing suffragettes, "You ought to be 'ome washin' your 'usband's trousers!" Ramses shoots back, "I assure you, sir, the lady's trousers are not in such sore need of laundering as your own." Peters also toys with differing narrative perspectives, and Ramses emerges as a possible successor to his mother's legacy of crime solving.<p> <i>The Ape Who Guards the Balance</i> begins in 1907 in England where Amelia is attending a suffragettes' rally outside the home of Mr. Geoffrey Romer of the House of Commons. It seems Romer is one of the few remaining private collectors of Egyptian antiquities, and a series of bizarre events at the protest soon embroil Amelia in grave personal danger. Suspecting that the Master Criminal, Sethos, is behind their problems, the Emerson Peabodys hasten to Egypt to continue their studies in the Valley of Kings where they soon acquire a papyrus of the <i>Book of the Dead</i>. As with past seasons, however, their archaeological expedition is interrupted. The murdered body of a woman is found in the Nile. Ramses, Radcliffe, and Amelia all have their theories as to the origin of the crime, but their own lives might soon be at stake if the cult of Thoth and their ancient book is, indeed, involved.</p><p> Other Peabody mysteries include <i>Seeing a Large Cat</i>, <i>The Hippopotamus Pool</i>, <i>The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog</i>, <i>The Deeds of the Disturber</i>, <i>Lion in the Valley</i>, <i>The Curse of the Pharaohs</i>, and <i>Crocodile on the Sandbank</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>After eluding a kidnapper in London, an unperturbed Amelia Peabody accompanies her unconventional family to Cairo once more&#x2014;only to be ensnared almost immediately in a web of stolen treasures and bloodthirsty cults. Villainy is running rampant in Egypt this 1907 archaeological season, but the members of the intrepid Peabody-Emerson clan have already proven themselves to be formidable adversaries. However, when a mint-condition papyrus of the Book of the Dead falls into their hands, and the corpse of an unscrupulous dealer in stolen antiquities is found floating in the Nile, the Emersons' prospects for surviving this excavation season unscathed appear increasingly dim.</p></p><h2>Capoeira: A Brazilian Art Form: History, Philosophy, and Practice</h2><p>Capoeira weaves fighting, music, dance, prayer, and ritual into an urgent strategy by which people live, struggle, celebrate, and survive together. In this book Bira Almeida--or Mestre Acordeon as he is respectfully called in capoeira circles--documents his own tradition with both the panoramic eye of the historian and the passionate heart of the capoeirista. He transports the reader from the damn of New World history in Brazil to the streets of twentieth-century Bahia (the spiritual home of capoeira) to the giant urban centers of North America (wher capoeira is now spreading in new lineages from the old masters).

The answers will turn Maggie&#x2019;s world upside-down and make her question everything she thought she knew about herself and her past. <b>In her efforts to rescue a defenseless young girl, Maggie finds that maybe she is the one who needs rescuing.</b></p><p>I was born and raised in Florida and now live in Tennessee. The South is as much a main character in my books as any of the people that populate them. From dirt roads in Alabama to coastal fishing towns in the Florida Panhandle, the south is so wonderfully filled with atmosphere and interesting people that I don&#39;t really see any reason for my writing to leave home. I write the occasional literary or women&#39;s fiction book, but my time is focused right now on The Forgotten Coast Florida series. This series, set in Apalachicola, FL, is a noirish suspense series, dripping with atmosphere and flawed, human, witty characters. The first four books in the series have an overarcing story that isn&#39;t resolved until book four (Landfall, releasing at the end of July 2015), but also subplots and mayhem and overall sinister dealings that are resolved in each book. The first four books are a foundation for the rest of the series, which will serve more as standalone novels. Whether you&#39;re reading See You or one of the Forgotten Coast books, you&#39;ll find they have in common dry humor, a good deal of atmosphere and characters who are people, rather than caricatures. I love these people, from 90-year old Creole nanny Miss Evangeline, to the droll and honorable Jack Canfield, to strong but damaged cop Maggie Redmond, and even the hilariously inappropriate and dangerously charming bad guy, Bennett Boudreaux. I hope that you&#39;ll meet them all, and love them all as I do.</p><h2>Yoga Therapy &amp; Integrative Medicine: Where Ancient Science Meets Modern Medicine</h2><p>Introducing the first Integrative Medical text to link modern medicine and alternative therapies to Yoga.

Graduating from Yale, his options were limitless.<br> &nbsp;<br> He chose public service.<br> &nbsp;<br> He chose to move to a rough neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, where he worked as a tenants&#x2019; rights lawyer before winning a seat on the City Council. In 2006, he was elected mayor, and for more than seven years he was the public face of an American city that had gone decades with too little positive national attention and investment. In 2013, Booker became the first African American elected to represent New Jersey in the U.S. Senate.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>United,</i> Cory Booker draws on personal experience to issue a stirring call to reorient our nation and our politics around the principles of compassion and solidarity. He speaks of rising above despair to engage with hope, pursuing our shared mission, and embracing our common destiny.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here is his account of his own political education, the moments&#x2014;some entertaining, some heartbreaking, all of them enlightening&#x2014;that have shaped his civic vision. Here are the lessons Booker learned from the remarkable people who inspired him to serve, men and women whose example fueled his desire to create opportunities for others. Here also are his observations on the issues he cares about most deeply, from race and crime and the crisis of mass incarceration to economic and environmental justice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hope is the active conviction that despair will never have the last word,&#x201d; Booker writes in this galvanizing book. In a world where we too easily lose touch with our neighbors, he argues, we must remember that we all rise or fall together&#x2014;and that we must move beyond mere tolerance for one another toward a deeper connection: love.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>United</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;An exceedingly good book, and an important book, and a reminder of what makes Booker an important and, through it all, a promising public figure.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>PolitickerNJ</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What sets Senator Booker&#x2019;s work apart from that of similar political books is that it seeks to elevate discourse rather than bring down opponents of the opposite partisan persuasion. This is a refreshing take, one that is truly worthy of study and contemplation.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Huffington Post</i></b></p><p><b>Cory Booker</b> is the junior United States senator from New Jersey. He was born in Washington, D.C., and his parents, who both worked for IBM, later relocated the family to Harrington Park, New Jersey. A star high school athlete, Booker received a football scholarship to Stanford University, where he earned his bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees. He then attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar before earning his law degree from Yale University. Booker won a special election to fill the term of the late Senator Frank Lautenberg to become New Jersey&#x2019;s first African American senator and only the twenty-first person in American history to ascend directly from mayor to senator.

If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go. &#x2014;James Baldwin</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I hate Henry Louis Gates Jr. <br> Okay, I don&#x2019;t, I love him. But can I at least say that he is guilty of assault and battery on my ego? That he has a talent for inflating the egos of others only to deftly and without warning pop them . . . and then to sport a rascally grin, as if to say, <i>What, did I do something?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> And what was the transgression committed by this public intellectual, this Harvard professor of African American studies, this award winning filmmaker and author and editor of dozens of books? It was calling me up and offering me a dream, saying something like, <i>Cory, hey, man, I&#x2019;ve got this show called </i>Finding Your Roots<i> where we trace the ancestry of two individuals . . .</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I knew about these shows, of course. The premise was to select well-known personalities&#x2014;Oprah, Chris Rock, Barbara Walters, John Legend, Martha Stewart&#x2014;and through research, DNA testing, and more, unearth their genealogical roots. The stories were fascinating and often shocking, complete with reveals in which guests lit up with joy or were struck with astonishment at the realization of who they are and where they come from. Many guests wept at the revelation. I think the good professor likes to make people cry on TV.<br> &nbsp;<br> I figured he was calling me to invite me to a premiere. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Well, we decided to do a special about two elected leaders, he said, and I want you to be one of them. Interested?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I almost dropped the phone. <i>Interested?</i> Are you kidding? I&#x2019;d love that. But are you sure? <br> &nbsp;<br> He responded with something like, <i>Absolutely. I thought it would be good to get someone from your generation, an up-and-comer . . .</i> <br> He went on saying such nice things about me. I didn&#x2019;t care whether or not they were true&#x2014;they were compliments from a man I looked up to. As we talked, I was full of excitement at the prospect of having my genealogy traced. Then I thought of something. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can I ask who you&#x2019;re pairing me with on the show?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>John Lewis</i>, he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> I said nothing. I might have stopped breathing. He repeated the name deliberately, perhaps to fill the silence, or maybe to stick it to me a bit more. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>John Lewis. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Congressman John Lewis is a living legend, and a hero of mine and to many. He was born a son of sharecroppers outside of Troy, Alabama. Inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis left Fisk University to go to the front lines of the civil rights movement in America. He helped found and was eventually named chairman of one of the most important civil rights organizations of the time: the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Lewis organized voter registration drives and sit-ins; he led the Freedom Rides; he was a keynote speaker at the March on Washington. More than once he was beaten during his nonviolent protests. He was renowned for his humility, self-sacrifice, and leadership, and was seen by many as one of the most courageous people in the civil rights movement. Today Lewis serves in the House of Representatives; thanks to his moral stature, his grace, and his statesmanship, he is considered the conscience of the Congress. <br> &nbsp;<br> All of which is to say that Henry Louis Gates Jr. had envisioned a show in which he would partner Jimmy Olsen with Superman. <br> &nbsp;<br> I did the show, and&#x2014;this is a phrase I don&#x2019;t throw around lightly&#x2014;it was life-changing. I&#x2019;m profoundly grateful to Professor Gates for the opportunity. But of course any viewer could detect the difference between our introductions. In my head, I heard the announcer in a deep TV-ready voice:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>John Lewis, hero of the civil rights movement, marching with grace and determination from Selma, Alabama, to the Edmund Pettus Bridge on what would become forever known as Bloody Sunday. He stood at the front lines of history, leading peaceful protestors, courageously standing and praying before Alabama state troopers. The troopers fired tear gas, then swarmed into the crowd, wearing gas masks and swinging billy clubs, hitting marchers, striking John Lewis in the skull. This righteous and courageous man literally bled the southern soil red for freedom. . . . </i><br> &nbsp;<br> And then, in that same splendiferous voice: <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>And Cory Booker, of suburban New Jersey, riding his Big Wheel toward his family&#x2019;s five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom house. He takes a turn too sharply . . . oh no! He falls off, skins his knee, and runs home screaming for his mother. He literally bled the northeastern soil red for . . . Big Wheel riders everywhere.</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> Like I said, I don&#x2019;t hate Henry Louis Gates Jr., because he managed to put my life in perspective, in light of what came before, in light of where I came from, in light of our collective American heritage. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t know it (or perhaps he did), but this invitation and his revelations about my family gave me my first full glimpse of the beautiful, seemingly infinite lattice that connects us all. It compelled me to look closer, to see how my family&#x2019;s journey intersected with and almost immediately benefited from John Lewis and all the others who marched onto that bridge. Their collective courage, leadership, and love helped to unlock a literal door for me and my family&#x2014;they helped to secure for my family and me a New Jersey home. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve said many times of my generation that we drink deeply from wells of freedom and opportunity that we did not dig, that we eat from tables prepared for us by our ancestors, that we sit comfortably in the shade of trees that we did not cultivate. We stand on the shoulders of giants. <br> &nbsp;<br> My family worked to have me understand that there are two interrelated ethics critical for citizenship. One is that we all must take responsibility for ourselves, invest in our own development, strive for personal excellence. My family taught me that we are all responsible for our own well-being, our growth, and most of all our attitude: <i>The most consequential daily decision you make, I was told, is the attitude you choose as you engage in your day.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> If I was doing a shoddy job of cleaning out the garage, my mother would give it to me about working with the right attitude, about a commitment to excellence. I would hear echoes of the civil rights movement in her lectures about personal accountability, complete with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. quotes tailored to the chore: &#x201c;If it falls your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures. Sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry. Sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will have to pause and say, &#x2018;Here lived a great street sweeper who swept his job well.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> But my family also insisted that personal ethic must be seamlessly bound with a larger communal ethic, a sense of connectedness: a recognition that we are all a part of something and have reaped the benefits of the struggles waged by those who had an unwavering commitment to the common good. From my earliest days, I was informed that I was the result of a conspiracy spanning space and time&#x2014;that billions of meritorious actions past and present yielded the abundance I enjoy. <br> &nbsp;<br> These twin ethics&#x2014;responsibility and connection&#x2014;reverberated throughout my young life, especially when I started to enjoy personal success. In my last years under my parents&#x2019; roof, my father would watch me walking around the house with a particular degree of teenage swagger, and he&#x2019;d make a crack: &#x201c;Son, don&#x2019;t you dare walk around this house like you hit a triple, &#x2019;cause you were born on third base.&#x201d; Then I would inevitably hear stories about my father&#x2019;s childhood: born poor, to a single mother, in the segregated South. He would detail the many people whose acts of kindness, decency, and love had enabled him to escape poverty and dislocation. He made it clear to me that I was&#x2014;that we in this generation are&#x2014;the physical manifestation of a conspiracy of love. The conspiracy of love wasn&#x2019;t conducted with grand gestures or expansive deeds; it was powered by people who practiced consistent acts of decency that, when combined over time and with the acts of others, carried a transformational power. My father made it clear to me as a child that I was alive because of the relentless actions of humble people who will never make it into a history book but define the character of this country. He called on me to be such a person, to always remember that the biggest thing you can offer on any given day is a small act of kindness.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Besieged (A Jake Mahegan Thriller)</h2><p><b>A Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year<br><br>&#x201c;Plenty to enjoy here.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> A school under siege.

In so doing, he sheds much-needed light on how Palestinians have experienced and perceived the broader conflict. During the Intifada, many of the martyrdom operations against Israeli targets were initiated in the West Bank town of Jenin and surrounding villages. Abufarha was born and raised in Jenin. His personal connections to the area enabled him to conduct ethnographic research there during the Intifada, while he was a student at a U.S. university. <p></p><p>Abufarha draws on the life histories of martyrs, interviews he conducted with their families and members of the groups that sponsored their operations, and examinations of Palestinian literature, art, performance, news stories, and political commentaries. He also assesses data&#x2014;about the bombers, targets, and fatalities caused&#x2014;from more than two hundred martyrdom operations carried out by Palestinian groups between 2001 and 2004. Some involved the use of explosive belts or the detonation of cars; others entailed armed attacks against Israeli targets (military and civilian) undertaken with the intent of fighting until death. In addition, he scrutinized suicide attacks executed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad between 1994 and 2000. In his analysis of Palestinian political violence, Abufarha takes into account Palestinians&#x2019; understanding of the history of the conflict with Israel, the effects of containment on Palestinians&#x2019; everyday lives, the disillusionment created by the Oslo peace process, and reactions to specific forms of Israeli state violence. <i>The Making of a Human Bomb</i> illuminates the Palestinians&#x2019; perspective on the conflict with Israel and provides a model for ethnographers seeking to make sense of political violence.</p></p><p>"<i>The Making of a Human Bomb</i> is a powerful book. Reflecting on suicide bombings, Nasser Abufarha explains more: the collective state of mind of the Palestinian population since the Oslo process broke down in 2000.

Muslims are our coworkers, neighbors and friends. But Christians don't always know how to build relationships with Muslims. Fouad Masri provides practical ways for Christians to initiate conversations and develop relationships with Muslims. He offers insights into Muslim culture and helps Christians understand and relate their Muslim friends. Masri addresses seven common questions that Muslims ask about Jesus and the Christian faith, providing sensitive answers that winsomely guide Muslims to Jesus without arguing or awkward debating. With real-life stories of fruitful conversations and genuine relationships, Masri helps readers see Muslims as Jesus sees them, without fear, with love, hope and expectation. You don't need a Ph.D. in Islam to share your faith with a Muslim. You just need the heart of an ambassador. Discover how.</p><p>Fouad Masri is founder and president of the Crescent Project, which nurtures transformational relationships between Christians and Muslims and overcomes misconceptions about Islam and Christianity. He was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, and received an MA in Islamic studies from Fuller Theological Seminary. His previous works include the <em>Bridges: Christians Connecting with Muslims</em> DVD curriculum and the books <em>Is the Injeel Corrupted?</em> and <em>Ambassadors to Muslims.</em>"We live in a world confused about Islam. Fouad Masri demystifies Islam and shows how to converse and build relationships with our Muslim co-workers and neighbors. He provides practical answers to seven common questions that Muslims ask about Christianity in a way that is nonthreatening and winsome, all the while sharing the biblical hope and love of Christ. With real-life stories, the author takes away the veil of Muslim culture and builds a bridge of trust between the two worlds that reveals the beauty of the gospel of Jesus." (Robert L. Gallagher, Outreach Magazine's Resources of the Year, March/April 2015)<br><br>"I'm grateful for Fouad Masri's <em>Connecting with Muslims. </em>This book shows how Christians and Muslims can connect with one another in real relationships of respect and trust. Fouad is an Arab Christian and a skilled communicator who can explain the cultural differences and bridge the gap between different worlds. He explains where Muslims are coming from in ways that Christians can understand, and he explains Christianity in ways that make sense to Muslims." (From the foreword by Josh McDowell, author and speaker)<br><br>"Full of evangelistic zeal and easy to read, Masri's <em>Connecting with Muslims</em> is a great book for individuals and churches that want to learn more about effectively engaging those of the Muslim faith." (Brandon Caudill, On Mission, Winter 2015)<br><br>"How can we share the gospel effectively with Muslims? In <em>Connecting with Muslims,</em> Fouad Masri, an Arab Christian, gives us helpful and practical insights on how we can convey the love of Christ to them. This is not a book of strategies or tactics. It is a guide to what we should understand about Islam and how Christianity may be understood by Muslims, so that we can faithfully represent Jesus. Relying on biblical principles, he shows us how to engage in and maintain fruitful conversations that lift up Christ without causing offense or compromising the gospel." (Winfried Corduan, author of Neighboring Faiths)<br><br>"Fouad Masri is a good friend and an effective communicator of the gospel to Muslims. Muslims are not 'missions projects' to him; they are people made in God's image. <em>Connecting with Muslims</em> is an expression of that attitude. It's easy to read and it's practical. It effectively demystifies Islam for anyone unfamiliar with it and encourages Christians to share the beauty and truth of the gospel with their Muslim friends." (Abdu Murray, speaker and author of Grand Central Question)<br><br>"<em>Connecting with Muslims</em> is a useful book on apologetics and bridge building in Muslim ministry. The arguments are historically and biblically sound. . . . This book certainly deserves to be on the shelf of every Christian who is interested in knowing how to communicate effectively with Muslims." (Abner P. Dizon, Journal of Asia Adventist Seminary, 16.2 (2013))<br><br>"Masri's book would be an excellent source for helpful information about Islam as well as a practical guide in how to use that material effectively in conversations with Muslims. Since there will only be an increased interaction between Christians and Muslims in our world, it would be good for all Christians to prepare themselves for opportunities to engage their Muslim neighbors in meaningful dialog about our faith. Masri's book would be the place to start."

He addresses such topics as widespread doctrinal confusion, the limits of papal authority, the documents of Vatican II, the Society of St. Pius X, anti-Christian ideologies and political threats, the third secret of Fatima, the traditional Roman rite, and the Amazon Synod, among many others. Like his fourth-century patron, St. Athanasius the Great, Bishop Schneider says things that others won't, fearlessly following St. Paul's advice: "Preach the word, be urgent in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, and exhort, be unfailing in patience and in teaching" (2 Tim 4:2). His insights into the challenges facing Christ's flock today are essential reading for those who are, or wish to be, alert to the signs of the times. Reminiscent of&nbsp;<i>The Ratzinger Report</i>&nbsp;of 1985,&nbsp;<i>Christus Vincit</i>&nbsp;will be a key point of reference for years to come.</p><p>"At this critical moment in the life of the Church we must reflect carefully on all that confronts us and discern what is true, good, and beautiful from what is evil. We cannot but be grateful to a faithful apostle such as Bishop Athanasius Schneider for his clear and courageous analysis of the state of the Church in our day. May this book assist all who read it in living their particular vocation with greater fidelity and zeal, for the glory of Almighty God and the salvation of souls."--<b>ROBERT CARDINAL SARAH</b><br><b></b><br>"No other bishop in recent memory has so tirelessly given of himself in the service of the truths of the Catholic Faith. In this wide-ranging interview, Bishop Schneider, through the account of his life and ministry and through his responses to the crucial questions of the day, gives powerful witness to his profound love of Our Lord and of His Mystical Body, the Church. This book will be of great help to the faithful, and to all people of good will, in navigating the grave confusion, division, and error prevalent in our times. It reveals the heart of a true shepherd of souls, after the Heart of Christ, the Good Shepherd."--<b>RAYMOND LEO CARDINAL BURKE</b><br><b></b><br>"St. Th�r�se of the Child Jesus ('the Little Flower') said that humility is courage for the truth, and courage to serve. Bishop Schneider is a humble and heroic witness to the truth, and a courageous servant. His love for Christ and the Church is strong and deep and heartfelt, like St. Paul's (Gal. 2:11-20). To the various questions regarding the crises we face (relativism, secularism, modernism, indifferentism), he responds as a faithful pastor and a perspicacious theologian. I found myself inspired and challenged."--<b>SCOTT HAHN</b><br><b></b><br>"A product of the persecuted Church in the Soviet Union, Bishop Athanasius Schneider powerfully appeals in this interview for a return to the classical doctrine, worship, and devotion of the Roman Church. Not all readers will agree with everything in his analyses, but they will find it difficult to dissent from his fundamental perception: the Church requires a radical re-supernaturalization that will save it from internal secularization, free it from the domination of all-too-human agendas, and inspire it with new ardor for its divinizing mission."--<b>FR. AIDAN NICHOLS, O.P.</b><br><b></b><br>"Reading this wide-ranging interview with one of the most outstanding bishops in the Church today is an experience of profound joy and gratitude. Bishop Schneider explains and defends Catholic truth with deep insight and total conviction.

This lens is the secret of narration, and it is ground anew in every story, ground between the temporal and the timeless ...In our brief mortal lives, we are grinders of these lenses&#39;. When John Berger wrote this apparently unclassifiable book, it was to become a sensation, translated into nine languages and indelible from the minds of those who read it. This stunning work is a shoebox filled with delicate love letters containing poetry and thoughts on mortality, art, love and absence, capturing moments in time that hover above Berger&#39;s surprising landscapes. From his lyrical description of the works of Caravaggio and profound explorations of death and immigration to the sight of some lilac at dusk in the mountains, this is a beautiful and most intimate response to the world around us.</p><p>In an extraordinary distillation of his gifts as a novelist, poet, art critic, and social historian, John Berger reveals the ties between love and absence, the ways poetry endows language with the assurance or prayer, and the tensions between the forward movement of sexuality and the steady backward tug of time.John Berger was born in London in 1926. His many books, innovative in form and far-reaching in their historical and political insight, include the Booker Prize-winning novel G, To the Wedding and King. Amongst his outstanding studies of art and photography are Another Way of Telling, The Success and Failure of Picasso, Titian: Nymph and Shepherd (with Katya Berger) and the internationally acclaimed Ways of Seeing. He lives and works in a small village in the French Alps, the setting for his trilogy Into Their Labours (Pig Earth, Once in Europa and Lilac and Flag). His collection of essays The Shape of a Pocket was published in 2001. His latest fiction, Here Is Where We Meet is published by Bloomsbury in 2005.</p><h2>The Sassafras Science Adventures 3: Volume 3: Botany</h2><p>In The Sassafras Science Adventures Volume Three Botany, the zip-lining science adventure advances for Blaine and Tracey Sassafras!

The child loved music from babyhood and when the family moved to Warsaw a few years after his birth, he was placed under the tutelage of the best masters of music in Poland. His astounding performance in playing the solo part of a difficult concerto with the full Warsaw orchestra when only nine years of age marked little Frederic as the genius he was. Through the early years to that momentous day in Vienna when his playing at the theater of Count Gallenberg actually launched his career as a major figure in the world of music, Frederic Chopin&#39;s childhood and boyhood are dramatically presented.

A heavy drinker since the age of 12 (alcohol had played a role in his crash), the accident could have been the beginning of a downward spiral. Instead, it sparked a personal transformation. After extensive physical therapy, he was eventually able to grasp a pen in his right hand and make rudimentary drawings. By 1978, Callahan had sworn off drinking for good, and begun to draw cartoons.</p><p>Over the next three decades, until his death in 2010, Callahan would become one of the nation&#x2019;s most beloved&#x2014;and at times polarizing&#x2014;cartoonists. His work, which shows off a wacky and sometimes warped sense of humor, pokes fun at social conventions and pushes boundaries.

The answer is yes, if the cartoonist is John Callahan -- whose infamous work has graced the pages of Omni, Penthouse, and The New Yorker -- and if he&#39;s telling it in his own words and pictures. But Callahan&#39;s uncensored account of his troubled -- and sometimes impossible -- life is also genuinely inspiring. Without self-pity or self-righteousness, this liberating book tells us how a quadriplegic with a healthy libido has sex, what it&#39;s like to live in the exitless maze of the welfare system, where a cartoonist finds his comedy, and how a man with no reason to believe in anything discovers his own brand of faith.</p><h2>The Practice of Ally Work: Meeting and Partnering with Your Spirit Guide in the Imaginal World (Jung on the Hudson Books)</h2><p><p>Jeff Raff has written about the ally (which has been called many different names in different traditions) in his books <i>Jung and the Alchemical Imagination</i>, <i>Healing the Wounded God</i>, and <i>The Wedding of Sophia</i>. Here, he shares with readers the techniques he has developed and taught in his workshops and lectures for achieving intimate contact with the divine.</p><p>The ally is a divine being, a face of God, that is unique to every being. It appears in the imaginal realm to partner with a specific person/ but it has to wait for its human partner to seek it. The person has to learn how to enter the imaginal realm to meet and relate with the ally, and to that effect, Raff has designed a progressive series of exercises. Starting with imagination-building practices, he takes you through learning how to identify your ally, learning its name, and obtaining guidance from it. Intermediate and advanced exercises teach you how to deepen your relationship with the ally and bring it into everyday life.</p><p>A relationship with your ally is a two-way street in that your attention to its existence in the imaginal realm makes it manifest in the material world, while the ally helps you achieve self-realization and gnosis in the literal sense of the word.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Raff received his B.A. from Bates College, a Master&#39;s in Psychology from the New School for Social Research, and a Ph.D. in Psychology from the Union Graduate School.

During this period millions of acres were awarded by the government. A multitude of records were generated, many of them providing important family information which family historians will be eager to locate. This guidebook explains what records are available, how to locate them, and includes an appendix of the important laws which generated the awards.</p><p>The author is a popular nationally known lecturer and award-winning author. Her keen interest in and knowledge of military bounty land is reflected in this book. She is a Board-certified genealogist and a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists, is the reicipient of the Donald Lines Jacobus award, the Professional Achievement Award, and the Distinguished Service Award. She has authored fifteen books on genealogy related subjects, including Courthouse Research for Family Historians, Genealogical Proof Standard, Courthouse Indexes Illustrated, Nicknames Past and Present, and others, and is the co-author of The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Genealogy. This book on bounty land is written in an easy-to-understand format, and includes many illustrations and step-by-step instructions on how to locate and use the records. It will be readily seen that the value of these far under-used records is immense.Christine Rose has given us a succinct detailed account of the rather complex and little understood military bounty land records. Not only does she provide the historical context but she also presents the legislation which generated the records. She links the records to their finding aids in both published and on-line indexes and how to obtain copies of the original source material. As a renaissance genealogist she brings to the records a lifetime of experience using bounty land records, and genealogists are forever in her debt for her work. --Lloyd deWitt Bockstruck, MLS, FNGS, retired librarian, Dallas Public Library; lecturer, author<br><br>A much-needed comprehensive guide to this genealogically and historically fascinating body of records. --James L. Hansen, Reference Librarian, Wisconsin Historical Society Library<br><br>Christine Rose's Military Bounty Land, 1776-1855, is the most detailed and authoritative treatment of the subject available today. The work is exemplary of its genre. Bounty land was public domain land that the United States government granted to more than 550,000 veterans of war-time military service between 1776 and 1855, or to the veteran s widow or other heirs. Rose s text demonstrates convincingly her stated premise: these records hold a lot more information than one would expect. Describing them, she quotes frequently from the original legislation that created them. Step-by-step she explains the process of applying for bounty land, securing a warrant, and locating a particular tract. Then she discusses a variety of finding aids online, microfilm and paper to help researchers use this rich and fascinating source. What might have been a dry and clinical treatise is brought vividly to life through Rose s frequent introduction of specific examples of real-life veterans and their true stories. The book focuses particular attention where it is warranted, including an entire chapter on Virginia s unique situation and another on the thousands of unindexed bounty land warrant application files housed in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. An appendix reproduces in chronological order all of the acts of Congress pertaining to bounty land and an extensive bibliography directs researchers to other works that treat particular aspects of this topic. With this work, Christine Rose has made an outstanding contribution not only to genealogy, but to historical research of all kinds. --John P. Colletta, PH.d., instructor, author, lecturer</p><h2>The Story of a Beautiful Girl</h2><p>It is 1968. Lynnie, a young white woman with a developmental disability, and Homan, an African American deaf man, are locked away in an institution,<i> </i>the School for the Incurable and Feebleminded, and have been left to languish, forgotten. Deeply in love, they escape, and find refuge in the farmhouse of Martha, a retired schoolteacher and widow. But the couple is not alone-Lynnie has just given birth to a baby girl. When the authorities catch up to them that same night, Homan escapes into the darkness, and Lynnie is caught. But before she is forced back into the institution, she whispers two words to Martha: "Hide her." And so begins the 40-year epic journey of Lynnie, Homan, Martha, and baby Julia-lives divided by seemingly insurmountable obstacles, yet drawn together by a secret pact and extraordinary love.</p><p>Rachel Simon is an award-winning author and nationally known public speaker. She is best known for her critically acclaimed, bestselling memoir <em>Riding The Bus with My Sister</em>, which was adapted for a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie of the same name. The book has garnered numerous awards, and is a frequent and much beloved selection of many book clubs, school reading programs, and city-wide reads throughout the country.In this enthralling love story, Lynnie, a young white developmentally disabled woman with limited speech, and Homan, a deaf African-American man, meet at the Pennsylvania State School for the Incurable and Feebleminded in the late 1960s. Despite strict rules, poor conditions, an abusive staff, and the couple's lack of language, Lynnie and Homan share tender moments. After their escape, a few days of freedom not only enables the secretly pregnant Lynnie to give birth outside the walls of the corrupt institution, it also secures the couple's admiration for one another. Fears of discovery force them to leave the baby in the hands of a nurturing widow, Martha Zimmer. Soon after, the school's staff apprehend Lynnie, while Homan flees. Although their stories diverge and unfold independently of one another, memories of their short time together sustain them for more than 40 years as they develop the confidence to eventually parent, learn to sign and speak, and finally, reunite. Simon (Riding the Bus with My Sister) who grew up with a developmentally disabled sister, has written an enormously affecting read, and provided sensitive insight into a complex world often dismissed by the "abled."

Herrington was an American intelligence advisor assigned to root out the enemy in the Hau Nghia province. His two-year mission to capture or kill Communist agents operating there was made all the more difficult by local officials who were reluctant to cooperate, villagers who were too scared to talk, and VC who would not go down without a fight. Herrington developed an unexpected but intense identification with the villagers in his jurisdiction&#x2013;and learned the hard way that experiencing war was profoundly different from philosophizing about it in a seminar room.</p><p><b>Stuart A. Herrington</b> was a counterintelligence officer in the Vietnam War. He served the last year of his thirty-year army career as a member of the faculty of the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania.&#x201c;A Model Revolutionary Village&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The closer the World Airways charter jet got to Vietnam, the quieter the two hundred GIs on board became. We approached Saigon&#x2019;s Tan Son Nhut Air Base at 5:00 A.M. Flares lit up the horizon sporadically as we glided down our approach, and we could see that the entire base was blacked out as we taxied to the reception area. The glow from the exhausts of the F-4 Phantoms in the concrete revetments reminded me of something I didn&#x2019;t need to be reminded of&#x2014;we were in a war zone. My stomach knew it before I did, and I felt lousy as we disembarked into the tropical heat and followed the MPs&#x2019; directions to the in-processing hangar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three days in Saigon convinced me that I didn&#x2019;t want to draw an assignment there. The city was filthy, overcrowded, hectic, and overrun with hustlers of all types. You name the negative modifier, it fit Saigon in early 1971. Not even the graffiti on the latrine walls at the reception center could dampen my enthusiasm for getting out of Saigon&#x2014;the sooner the better.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Vietnamese flag is well-designed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where they&#x2019;re not red, they&#x2019;re yellow.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the good lord had wanted me to come to this stinking land and walk through the swamps for a year, he would have given me baggy green skin.<br> &nbsp;<br> [Penned in immediately below:]<br> Don&#x2019;t worry. After one year, you&#x2019;ll have baggy green skin!<br> &nbsp;<br> I had a game plan to get a good assignment, if indeed there was such a thing in Vietnam. A friend of mine had just returned from a tour in Phuoc Tuy, a coastal province southeast of Saigon best known for its resort town of Vung Tau. He had described duty in Phuoc Tuy in glowing terms&#x2014;silver beaches, giant lobsters, and not too many Vietcong. There was even a contingent of fun-loving Australians stationed in the province, and my friend told incredible tales of their nonmilitary exploits. The plan was for me to go to the officer assignment folks at headquarters, rattle off a few words of Vietnamese, and Vung Tau, here I come.<br> &nbsp;<br> It didn&#x2019;t work. The sergeant in the assignments branch merely laughed as he explained that Phuoc Tuy province would not hold all of the men who had volunteered to go there in the defense of democracy. The best I was able to do was to wrangle orders to Military Region III, the area around Saigon. I was to report the following morning to Bien Hoa city, a few miles north of Saigon, for an interview with a colonel who would decide where I would actually be assigned.<br> &nbsp;<br> The colonel turned out to be the officer who was responsible for the &#x201c;Phoenix&#x201d; program in Military Region III. Phoenix was the code name for the attack on the Vietcong shadow government. The interview lasted only a few minutes. The colonel told me that since I had done so well at language school, Hau Nghia province would be the perfect assignment for me. Province Senior Advisor Colonel Jack Weissinger was a &#x201c;hard-charger&#x201d; who had already served almost two years in Hau Nghia. The colonel explained that Weissinger &#x201c;needed good people,&#x201d; and I was to fly the following morning to Hau Nghia on the daily courier flight.<br> &nbsp;<br> I went to the club that last night in Bien Hoa and sat at the bar downing Budweisers in a futile attempt to conceal my concern for what lay ahead. I had already figured out what &#x201c;Weissinger needs good men&#x201d; meant. Hau Nghia was not Phuoc Tuy. I was scared, and the Vietnamese and Americans at the club didn&#x2019;t offer much solace. The Americans nodded knowingly when I told them I was going to Hau Nghia. It seemed that Hau Nghia province was famous for two things&#x2014;Colonel Jack Weissinger and the Vietcong. The issue was in doubt whether it was Colonel Weissinger or the Vietcong that was the most feared thing about the province.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried out my school Vietnamese on the girls who tended bar. It was interesting to watch their surprised reaction when an American spoke their language. Their initial response was always the same; they asked a series of questions that to an American seemed nosey:<br> &nbsp;<br> How old are you, captain?<br> Do you have a wife, captain?<br> How many children do you have, captain?<br> How much do you weigh, captain?<br> Where are you going, captain?<br> &nbsp;<br> And when I answered &#x201c;Hau Nghia&#x201d; to this last question, the response was ominous. &#x201c;Oh God, Dai Uy!<br> &nbsp;<br> Hau Nghia! Beaucoup VC, Dai Uy!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I spent that last night in the transient billets, watching the occasional flares and the streams of tracers that erupted on the horizon around the perimeter of the base. I could hear the &#x201c;thud&#x201d; of outgoing artillery, and found myself wondering if the perimeter were under attack. Later I learned that the artillerymen were firing routine &#x201c;H and I&#x201d; (harassment and interdiction) missions at suspected enemy locations. The flares and tracers I had seen were also routine&#x2014;the troops periodically opened fire to test their weapons and to let the enemy know that they were awake. Unfortunately, no one told me all of this in Bien Hoa, so I slept with my M-16 rifle uncomfortably draped over one arm.<br> &nbsp;<br> I flew to Hau Nghia in a Swiss-built Porter aircraft that was known for its short takeoff and landing capabilities. During the short flight, I had the first of many looks at Vietnam from the air. I can still recall my pure astonishment at the lush beauty of the countryside. Conditioned as I was by the images of Vietnam drawn by others for the American people, I was unprepared for the tropical beauty that was spread out below. What about the infamous defoliation operations? Where were the wasted &#x201c;free-fire zones&#x201d; that I had read about? Hadn&#x2019;t our artillery laid waste to vast stretches of the rural countryside? Finally, around a triangular mud fort somewhere west of Bien Hoa, I spotted a sea of craters. Still, what I saw (and what I didn&#x2019;t see) during that flight activated a tiny caution lamp in my head, and I warned myself to be careful of preconceived notions and generalizations.<br> &nbsp;<br> My thoughts on the rural beauty of Vietnam came to an abrupt halt as the pilot demonstrated his aircraft&#x2019;s tricks. From five thousand feet directly above the Hau Nghia airstrip, he corkscrewed his way down and landed in a stomach-turner that made a believer out of me. The aircraft halted almost instantly. The pilot yelled at me to get out, and the enlisted mail clerk threw the cargo out on the runway. The entire operation took less than a minute. Just when I thought I was going to be left alone on the tiny airstrip, a jeep charged around the tail of the aircraft, and within seconds I was on my way to the headquarters of Advisory Team 43. The silver aircraft was airborne within thirty seconds. First Sergeant Willie Tate, the jeep driver, introduced himself and made an unflattering reference to skittish civilian pilots.<br> &nbsp;<br> The province capital of Bao Trai consisted of a single asphalt main street which was crowded with peasants on their way to and from the bustling central market. Both sides of the street were lined with small shops, and the town&#x2019;s citizens walked in the middle of the street, oblivious to the intrusions of the motorbikes and three-wheeled Lambrettas that plied their way back and forth. Chickens, ducks, dogs, and even pigs roamed the streets freely, and Tate maneuvered around the plodding ox carts of the farmers. The sergeant pushed the jeep through the chaos, blowing his horn impatiently. Bao Trai was dirty, crowded, and small. If this was the province capital, what would a district town look like?<br> &nbsp;<br> The ride through Bao Trai took only a couple of minutes with Tate driving. It would have taken me three times as long. We pulled into the walled compound that housed the advisory team, and the sergeant informed me that I would stay there for one or two nights before going one step farther&#x2014;to one of Hau Nghia province&#x2019;s four districts.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the team&#x2019;s orderly room, I learned the worst. There had been a memorial service that morning for two men who had been killed in an ambush earlier in the week. The unfortunate men had been stationed in Cu Chi, one of the four districts. When a government outpost in their district came under a Vietcong attack, the two advisors jumped in their jeep and followed their Vietnamese counterparts to the scene of the action. They never made it. The Vietcong ambushed their hastily formed (and poorly thought-out) reaction force, and both were killed when an antitank rocket hit their jeep.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later in the day, I met Maj. Dick Culp, the intelligence officer who ran the American side of the Hau Nghia Phoenix effort. The major explained the peculiarities of the program in Hau Nghia. The mission, he explained, was quite easy to define&#x2014;kill or capture Vietcong agents&#x2014;but it was seemingly impossible to get the Vietnamese to accomplish it. Our job as Phoenix advisors was to assist the Vietnamese intelligence services (our counterparts) in identifying the members of the &#x201c;Vietcong infrastructure&#x201d; (VCI) and in planning the operations to &#x201c;neutralize&#x201d; them. Neutralize was a euphemism that actually meant kill, capture, or convince to surrender.<br> &nbsp;<br> Culp was obviously a frustrated man, discouraged because he believed in the rationale of the Phoenix concept, but had been unable to get the Vietnamese to cooperate in its execution. I sensed from his remarks that Colonel Weissinger was a problem, though he discreetly avoided discussing the details of his relationship with the colonel. Other members of the team cautioned me that being a Phoenix advisor on Team 43 was risky business and that the risks had more to do with Colonel Weissinger than they did with the Vietcong.</p><h2>American Power and the New Mandarins: Historical and Political Essays</h2><p><p><em>American Power and the New Mandarins</em> is Noam Chomsky&#x2019;s first political book, widely considered to be among the most cogent and powerful statements against the American war in Vietnam. Long out of print, this collection of early, seminal essays helped to establish Chomsky as a leading critic of United States foreign policy. These pages mount a scathing critique of the contradictions of the war, and an indictment of the mainstream, liberal intellectuals&#x2014;the &#x201c;new mandarins&#x201d;&#x2014;who furnished what Chomsky argued was the necessary ideological cover for the horrors visited on the Vietnamese people.</p><p>As America&#x2019;s foreign entanglements deepen by the month, Chomsky&#x2019;s lucid analysis is a sobering reminder of the perils of imperial diplomacy. With a new foreword by Howard Zinn, author of <em>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</em>, <em>American Power and the New Mandarins</em> is a renewed call for independent analysis of America&#x2019;s role in the world. </p><br></p><p>Noam Chomsky is the Institute Professor and a professor of linguistics, emeritus, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A world-renowned linguist and political activist, he is the author of numerous books, including <em>On Language: Chomsky&#x2019;s Classic Works </em>Language and Responsibility<em> and </em>Reflections on Language; <em>Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky</em>, edited by Peter R.

He lives in Lexington, Massachusetts.<br>Whether assessing U.S. policy in the Middle East (Fateful Triangle) or analyzing the events of September 11 (9-11), linguist, intellectual giant and moral authority Chomsky has made a brilliant career out of telling his fellow Americans things they didn't want to hear. And it all began with this collection of provocative essays (first published by Pantheon in 1969), each advancing a cogent, rigorous argument for why we shouldn't have been in Vietnam. In his opening piece, Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship, Chomsky establishes the premise that U.S. presence in Southeast Asia was little more than updated imperialism; that theory informs much of the writing that follows. In The Logic of Withdrawal, Chomsky methodically debunks the accepted reasons for U.S. intervention in a foreign civil war, and in On Resistance, he restates his case even more bluntly, writing that no one has appointed us judge and executioner for Vietnam or anywhere else. If it merely recalled the heady debates of a generation past, this volume would have been well worth reprinting. But at this moment in history, as America teeters on the brink of another war, Chomsky's ruminations about our role on the world stage take on renewed relevance. <br> Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Disability Aesthetics (Corporealities: Discourses Of Disability)</h2><p>"<i>Disability Aesthetics</i> ambitiously redefines both 'disability' and 'aesthetics,' showing us that disability is central not only to modern art but also to the way we apprehend (and interact with) bodies and buildings. Along the way, Tobin Siebers revisits the beautiful and the sublime, 'degenerate' art and 'disqualified' bodies, culture wars and condemned neighborhoods, the art of Marc Quinn and the fiction of Junot D�az---and much, much more. <i>Disability Aesthetics</i> is a stunning achievement, a must-read for anyone interested in how to understand the world we half create and half perceive."<br>---Michael B�rub�, Paterno Family Professor in Literature, Pennsylvania State University<br>"Rich with examples of the disabled body in both historical and modern art, Tobin Siebers's new book explores how disability problematizes commonly accepted ideas about aesthetics and beauty. For Siebers, disability is not a pejorative condition as much as it is a form of embodied difference. He is as comfortable discussing the Venus de Milo as he is discussing Andy Warhol. <i>Disability Aesthetics</i> is a prescient and much-needed contribution to visual &amp; critical studies."<br>---Joseph Grigely, Professor of Visual and Critical Studies, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago<br><br><br><br><i>Disability Aesthetics</i> is the first attempt to theorize the representation of disability in modern art and visual culture. It claims that the modern in art is perceived as disability, and that disability is evolving into an aesthetic value in itself. It argues that the essential arguments at the heart of the American culture wars in the late twentieth century involved the rejection of disability both by targeting certain artworks as "sick" and by characterizing these artworks as representative of a sick culture. The book also tracks the seminal role of National Socialism in perceiving the powerful connection between modern art and disability. It probes a variety of central aesthetic questions, producing a new understanding of art vandalism, an argument about the centrality of wounded bodies to global communication, and a systematic reading of the use put to aesthetics to justify the oppression of disabled people. In this richly illustrated and accessibly written book, Tobin Siebers masterfully demonstrates the crucial roles that the disabled mind and disabled body have played in the evolution of modern aesthetics, unveiling disability as a unique resource discovered by modern art and then embraced by it as a defining concept.<br>Tobin Siebers is V.

It recovers forgotten and obscured moments in church history to help us to realize a richer and fuller understanding of Christianity.</p><p>This text provides an overview of the complete sweep of Christian history through the lens of feminist scholarship. Yet it also departs from some of the assumptions of that scholarship, raising questions that challenge our thinking about how women have shaped beliefs and practices during two thousand years of church history. Did the emphasis on virginity in the early church empower Christian women? Did the emphasis on marriage during the Reformations of the sixteenth century improve their status? These questions and others have important implications for women in Christianity in particular, and for women in religion in general, since they go to the heart of the human condition.</p><p>This work examines themes, movements, and events in their historical contexts and locates churchwomen within the broader developments that have been pivotal in the evolution of Christianity. From the earliest disciples to the latest theologians, from the missionaries to the martyrs, women have been instrumental in keeping the faith alive. Women in Christian Traditions shows how they did so.</p><p>Additional Resources</p></p><p><b>Rebecca Moore</b> is Professor of Religious Studies at San Diego State University.

In the Soviet Union of his era, where the collective was of the utmost importance, Tarkovsky dared to create his own provocatively original style of filmmaking. His nonrealistic, highly charged images continued to be a source of inspiration-not only for a new generation of filmmakers but also for poets, musicians, and painters-even after he defected to the West, where Nostalgia was shot in Italy in 1983. His last film, The Sacrifice, was filmed in Sweden with Ingmar Bergman's collaborators. This volume collects his great works, including Solaris, Mirror, Stalker, Nostalgia, The Sacrifice, and Ivan's Childhood. These scripts deepen and expand our understanding of Tarkovsky's films, for they map out the early stages and personages (some never embodied on the screen) and help to clarify the obscure characters, images, and sequences that are so central to this great filmmaker's unique work. <p>Filmography </p><p>Andrei Tarkovsky died in Paris in 1986. William Powell previously translated The Selected Writings of Sergei Eisenstein. He lives in London.</p></p><p>Tarkovsky is for me the greatest, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream -- <i>Ingmar Bergman</i></p><h2>The Sense of Beauty: Being the Outline of Aesthetic Theory</h2><p><p>It is remarkably appropriate that this work on aesthetics should have been written by George Santayana, who is probably the most brilliant philosophic writer and the philosopher with the strongest sense of beauty since Plato. It is not a dry metaphysical treatise, as works on aesthetics so often are, but is itself a fascinating document: as much a revelation of the beauty of language as of the concept of beauty.<br>This unabridged reproduction of the 1896 edition of lectures delivered at Harvard College is a study of "why, when, and how beauty appears, what conditions an object must fulfill to be beautiful, what elements of our nature make us sensible of beauty, and what the relation is between the constitution of the object and the excitement of our susceptibility."<br>Santayana first analyzes the nature of beauty, finding it irrational, "pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing." He then proceeds to the materials of beauty, showing what all human functions can contribute: love, social instincts, senses, etc. Beauty of form is then analyzed, and finally the author discusses the expression of beauty. Literature, religion, values, evil, wit, humor, and the possibility of finite perfection are all examined. Presentation throughout the work is concrete and easy to follow, with examples drawn from art, history, anthropology, psychology, and similar areas.</p><p></p></p><p>George Santayana was for many years a professor of philosophy at Harvard University.</p><h2>Cruisin&#39; the Fossil Freeway Map: The Ultimate Prehistoric Road Map to the Best of the American West</h2><p>An illustrated companion map for <i>Cruisin' the Fossil Freeway</i>, which follows the zany travels of a paleontologist and an artist as they drive across the American West in search of fossils.</p><p><b>Kirk R.

It is one of faithfulness from the beginning through to its tragic ending.</p><p>Richard and Margaret Baxter had been married only nineteen years before she died at age forty-five. A prominent pastor and prolific author, Baxter sought consolation and relief the only true way he knew- in Scripture with his discipline of writing.

It is spiritual storytelling at its best, made all the more poignant by the author's unveiling of his grief.</p><p>J. I.

He guides you in comparing and contrasting the world's and the Bible's ideals on coping with these tides of life.

She has worked all over the world, even hosting her on morning show. She is the author of <i>Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure.&nbsp;</i>1 | Through the Looking Glass<br>I have a dreadful long-term memory. I only remember two traumatic events of my childhood--my brother's near-death by drowning and my own near-death by humiliation when I was rescued by a lifeguard while attempting my first lap of the butterfly stroke in the local pool. I vaguely remember truth or dare kisses in the back of a bus, aged about twelve, dancing to "My Sharona" at thirteen, behaving like an absolute arsehole in my adolescence and having a hideous hippie phase involving dreadlocks and tie-dye when I was at college.<br><br>For my twenty-first birthday my parents gave me a plane ticket and a blessing to leave home and Australia for a year. This middle-class rite of passage had become a family tradition--my mother had hitchhiked around Europe in the fifties and wanted us all to experience the joy of travel before we settled into careers. My trip through Europe, Egypt and Turkey is a bit of a blur and recollections of the two-month tour of India on the way home are vague. I can see myself roadside squatting and peeing with women in wonderful saris, sunset games of beach cricket with a trinity of fat Goan men named Jesus, Joseph and Jude, and the white bright teeth of a child rickshaw driver wearing a T-shirt printed with come on aussie come on. I recall angst, incredible anger, deep depression and a love-hate relationship with the country, but I can't remember why. I'd filed the soothsayer, his prophecies and my vow never to return under "young stupid rubbish" and let it fall deep into the black hole of my brain.<br><br>Until now--a month short of eleven years later.<br><br>As I walk into the plane in Singapore, a seed starts to sprout in the blocked sewer of my memory; a seed watered by the essence of stale urine and the whiff of vomit coming from my window seat (where the pink and orange paisley wallpaper artfully camouflages the spew). The high-pitched, highly excited jumble of Indian voices almost germinates a recollection. But after too many going-away parties, involving too much indulgence, I'm too wasted to let the bud bloom. I fall asleep.<br><br>Somewhere over Chennai I become aware of an increasingly rhythmic prodding of my inner thigh by something long, thin and hard. I open my eyes to see a brown finger with a long curved nail closing in on my crotch. The digit is attached to a scrawny old Sikh in a turban sitting beside me. He is slobbering and shaking with excitement. I'm too sleepy, shocked and, for some reason, too embarrassed to scream, so I buzz for sisterly assistance.<br><br>An air hostess with big hair, long nails and drag-queen makeup slowly strolls over. She looks cranky.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"This man is touching me when I sleep," I bleat indignantly.<br><br>The hostess rolls her eyes and waggles her finger.<br><br>At me.<br><br>"Well, stay awake and don't let it happen again, madam."<br><br>She wheels on the spot and strides off, swishing her nylon sari.<br><br>Months later a friend will tell me that many Indian flight attendants are rich girls whose parents pay a massive bribe to get them a job involving travel and five-star hotels. These brats view passengers as pesky intrusions way beneath their status, and detest doing the job of a high-flying servant. But right now, I'm floored, abandoned and angry.<br><br>I stay wide-awake and alert until the hostess with the mostest sprays the cabin with foul-smelling insecticide. She aims an extra jet directly at my head. I can almost hear her thinking, This should clean the Western whore.<br><br>It's now that I remember that India is like Wonderland. In this other universe everyone seems mad and everything is upside down, back to front and infuriatingly bizarre. I'm Alice: fuzzy with feelings about my previous trip down the rabbit hole, I'm now flying straight back through the looking glass to a place where women are blamed for sleazy men and planes are sprayed when they fly from a clean city to a dirty one. In this world we applaud a dreadful landing that's as fast and steep as a takeoff, we jump up and tackle fellow passengers in a crush at the door while the plane is still moving, and the air hostess gets off first.<br><br>I get off last to be embraced by the cold and clammy smog. The cocktail of damp diesel fumes, swirling dust, burning cow dung, toxic chemicals, spicy sweat and sandalwood wraps me in memories. The soothsayer and his prophecies of a decade ago boil to the surface of my brain.<br><br>For the old bloke did give a good hand job.<br><br>My friend Nic got married soon after we came home; she then quickly popped out two gorgeous girls and has never come back to India. I'm still single and at thirty-three, by Indian standards, I'm a spinster to be pitied. I've had good jobbing--only days ago I finished my last Morning Show on the Triple J network. I've interviewed famous actors, crazed celebrities and brilliant musicians; I've talked with an audience I admire; and I've enjoyed a lifestyle of traveling, film premieres, theater opening nights, music gigs and festivals. I've left the best job in the world for a country that I now remember hating with a passion. And I've done it for love. My boyfriend, Jonathan, is the Australian Broadcasting Company's South Asia correspondent based in New Delhi, and after a year of yearning, soppy love songs and pathetic phone calls, we've decided we can't live apart. I look to see if the toilet cleaner is here to gloat.<br><br>A different tarmac welcoming committee emerges from the mist--five men with massive mustaches, machine guns and moronic stares, each of them clutching his own penis.<br><br>I then spend hours inching along an impossibly slow passport queue comprised of harassed foreigners, while Indians move past smiling. It takes half an hour to find my bags in the midst of a screaming and jumping porter mosh pit and another twenty minutes to have my luggage X-rayed again. By the time I am near the exit I'm frantic that I'm late for my most important date. I rush down a long exit ramp that gets steeper and steeper, pulling my trolley deeper and faster into India. I hit the bottom with a bump and fall over. Dazed, disoriented and dusty, I sense a strange sight and sound emerging from the smog. A huge hurricane fence appears to be alive. It's rocking and writhing--fingers, toes and small arms reach through wire gaps; heads poke over the barbed wire, and mouths pressed to the steel groan and moan.<br><br>"Taxieeee, taxieee, madam, taxiee, baksheesh, money."<br><br>Before I can pick myself up, an arm breaks through a hole in the fence, grabs my bags and starts to disappear back into the misty melee. I begin a tug of war with a person I can't see. I start to scream. "Stop. Come back, I'm getting picked up."<br><br>"No, no, you are too late, your car not coming, I am taking you," yells a voice from the end of the arm.<br><br>Could he be right? Could Jonathan have come and gone? Or been held up on a story? My doubt weakens me and I lose my grip on my bags and fall flat on my back.<br><br>Then, through the smog, a tall being with a familiar grin emerges. Jonathan rescues me, grabbing my bags from the invisible man and me to his chest. I'm momentarily comforted, then I pull away and hit him.<br><br>"You're late," I wail pathetically. Jonathan recoils like a wounded boy. This is hardly the romantic reunion we'd pictured, and not how I wanted my new life in a new country to begin.<br><br>Jonathan bundles me into the Australian Broadcasting Company car with a promise of a stiff drink and a warm new home. We drive slowly through New Delhi's winter streets which seem like hell frozen over, or perhaps purgatory. I can't see beside or beyond the car. Foghorns hail from huge trucks sailing too close for comfort, and every time we stop at a red traffic light, which impossibly instructs us to relax in large white uneven letters, a ghostly torso or a gaunt face with an expression straight from The Scream rises from the milky depths. Long, skinny Addams family fingers rap on the window--death knocks from beggars. I shrink from the beings as if they're lepers and then realize many actually are. Still freaked from seeing bits of people through the airport fence, I'm now scared by seeing people without bits.<br><br>We stop at a huge black gate opened by a very small man with an extraordinarily large mustache and an even bigger smile. It appears he has won a beauty contest of some sort, as he's wearing a white pants suit with a red sash that says west end. Beyond Mr. West End looms my new home. I hit Jonathan again: I've left a sunny apartment by the sea in Sydney for a dark, dingy first-floor flat on the intersection of two of New Delhi's busiest roads.<br><br>Inside, the flat is large but lifeless; its white walls are stained with diesel fumes and bordered with dark wood; its marble floors are cold, cracked and yellow; its rooms almost empty, bar some ugly, Australian Broadcasting Company-issue pine furniture. Jonathan is a house-proud bloke, but he left most of his things in Australia and has been traveling almost constantly for a year. He quickly promises we will move or renovate. I try not to look too disappointed and he perks me up with champagne and a bedroom strewn with rose petals.<br><br>We fall asleep rocked by the reassurance of a love reunion and the traffic vibrations.<br>The next morning, after a Sunday sleep-in, we wake wrapped in a noxious cloud of smog and dirty diesel fumes. Marooned inside on the couch we sip chai--gorgeous tea made with cinnamon, ginger, boiled milk and a tablespoon of sugar. When the smog lifts we move to the deck to watch a roaring rough sea of traffic wildlife. All around us a furious knot of men and metal constantly unravels and re-forms, ebbing and flowing and going nowhere fast.<br><br>Blokes--and a friend or two--perch atop tall, rusty bicycles. Entire families share motorcycles; toddlers stand between dads' knees or clutch his back, and wives sit sidesaddle while snuggling babies. Auto-rickshaws zip around like tin toys. Ambassador cars--half Rolls-Royce and half Soviet tank--cruise with class. Huge tinsel-decorated trucks rumble and groan, filthy lime-green buses fly around like kamikaze cans squeezing out a chunky sauce of arms and legs. Shoes dangle from back bumpers and black demonic faces poke out red tongues from windshields; these are for good luck. But it's probably the holy mantra written on the backs of vehicles that keeps things moving It's not baby on board, or jesus saves, or triple m does delhi. Instead, hand-painted in swirling childish capital letters is: horn please.<br><br>Everyone seems to drive with one finger on the horn and another shoved high up a nostril. The highway soundtrack is a chaotic symphony of deep blasts, staccato honks, high-pitched beeps, musical notes and a weird duck drone. It's as if Delhi is blind and driving by sound--except it seems many are deaf. Women are curled up on the pavement sound asleep, and a man is stretched out on the median strip, dead to the danger. On the backs of bikes, on the laps of the motorcycle mums, babies are floppy with dreams.<br><br>It's clear it would be suicide to drive here and luckily I won't have to. The Australian Broadcasting Company has a driver, Abraham. Abraham's thick curls have crawled off his head like furry caterpillars and they now encircle his ears. He wears a mean pair of black Cuban-heeled cowboy boots and fake Levi's.<br><br>But Abe is no cowboy. Small, skinny and incredibly jumpy, he's worked for the Australian Broadcasting Company for twenty-five years but still seems nervous around boss-sahibs. He wrings his hands when Jonathan asks him a question, and whispers answers so quietly we have to lean close to pick them up. This just makes him more nervous and he jumps back as if we are going to hit him. Mild-mannered Abe, however, is Tarzan of the traffic jungle. He knows the strict species pecking order: pedestrians are on the bottom and run out of the way of everything, bicycles make way for cycle-rickshaws, which give way to auto-rickshaws, which stop for cars, which are subservient to trucks. Buses stop for one thing and one thing only. Not customers--they jump on while the buses are still moving. The only thing that can stop a bus is the king of the road, the lord of the jungle and the top dog.<br><br>The holy cow.<br><br>Eighty-two percent of Indians are Hindus. Hindus revere cows, probably because one of their favorite gods, Krishna, is a cowherd, and Shiva--the Lord of Destruction--has a bull called Nandi.<br><br>I've always thought it hilarious that Indian people chose the most boring, domesticated, compliant and stupid animal on earth to adore, but already I'm seeing cows in a whole different light. These animals clearly know they rule and they like to mess with our heads. The humpbacked bovines step off median strips just as cars are approaching, they stare down drivers daring them to charge, they turn their noses up at passing elephants and camels, and hold huddles at the busiest intersections where they seem to chat away like the bulls of Gary Larson cartoons. It's clear they are enjoying themselves.<br><br>But for animals powerful enough to stop traffic and holy enough that they'll never become steak, cows are treated dreadfully. Scrawny and sickly, they survive by grazing on garbage that's dumped in plastic bags. The bags collect in their stomachs and strangulate their innards, killing the cows slowly and painfully. Jonathan has already done a story about the urban cowboys of New Delhi who lasso the animals and take them to volunteer vets for operations. Unfortunately the cows are privately owned and once they are restored to health they must be released to eat more plastic.<br><br>New Delhi and its cows can wait, though. Jonathan and I need a week's holiday and a catch-up after a year apart.<br>Before dawn on Monday morning, Abraham drives us through wide avenues, around green traffic circles, past a flower market, and drops us at the New Delhi train station, which doubles as a pavement hotel--rows and rows of bodies stretch across the station--entire families snoring away atop ripped sheets of plastic, filthy rags or just the hard concrete ground.<br><br>We negotiate an obstacle course of bodies lying comatose on the concrete as we scamper after a scrawny porter who insists on carrying our backpacks upon his head. The old bloke keeps stumbling and shakes with Parkinson's disease, so Jonathan ends up carrying our bags and very nearly the porter, who looks at our train seats with an obvious longing for a good nap. Feeling sorry for him, I hand him fifty rupees (one dollar). But just before the train lurches from the platform, he's back, yelling at me about "no-good money" and throwing the notes on my lap. I look down and swear--I've accidentally given him fifty American dollars and the poor guy has no idea of its worth. Humiliated more by his mistake than mine, I hand him one hundred rupees to appease us both. He stumbles off singing with delight and a crowd gathers around him in shock. It's way too much. (For the next two years the porters at New Delhi station will recognize me as the Mad Madam who paid two dollars for nothing, and demand a similarly huge sum. Some will even shake to arouse my sympathy.)</p><h2>Michael Jackson All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track</h2><p><br><b>The complete, definitive study of Michael Jackson's artistic legacy.</b><br><br>This is the only book that tells the story behind every single song that the King of Pop ever released - from his formative years with the Jackson Five to his incredible and much-loved output as a solo artist.

Trimble, offers a new paradigm for examining leadership by bringing together two domains&#x2014;research on leadership and research on diversity&#x2014;to challenge existing notions of leadership and move toward a diverse and global view of society and its institutions. This compelling book delivers an approach to leadership that is inclusive, promotes access for diverse leaders, and addresses barriers that narrowly confine our perceptions and expectations of leaders. Redefining leadership as global and diverse, the authors impart new understanding of who our leaders are, the process of communication, exchange between leaders and their members, criteria for selecting, training, and evaluating leaders in the 21st century, and the organizational and societal contexts in which leadership is exercised.</p><p><strong>Jean Lau Chin</strong>, EdD, ABPP (Teachers College, Columbia University) is a professor of psychology at Adelphi University.

There are already historical studies of musicology, logic, art history, linguistics, and historiography, but this volume gathers these, and many other humanities disciplines, into a single coherent account. <br><br>Its central theme is the way in which scholars throughout the ages and in virtually all civilizations have sought to identify patterns in texts, art, music, languages, literature, and the past. What rules can we apply if we wish to determine whether a tale about the past is trustworthy? By what criteria are we to distinguish consonant from dissonant musical intervals? What rules jointly describe all possible grammatical sentences in a language? How can modern digital methods enhance pattern-seeking in the humanities? Rens Bod contends that the hallowed opposition between the sciences (mathematical, experimental, dominated by universal laws) and the humanities (allegedly concerned with unique events and hermeneutic methods) is a mistake born of a myopic failure to appreciate the pattern-seeking that lies at the heart of this inquiry. <br><br><em>A New History of the Humanities</em> amounts to a persuasive plea to give Panini, Valla, Bopp, and countless other often overlooked intellectual giants their rightful place next to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rens Bod </strong>is a professor at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. He has published extensively on linguistics and the history of the humanities.<br><br>"An extraordinarily ambitious undertaking....What Bod has written is not just a 'new' history. It is the first ever history of its kind."-- Noel Malcolm, <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Bod's book is designed as an opening salvo in a grand project to develop the history of the humanities as a subfield on par with (and potentially in close alliance with) the history of science, with a view to building a history of knowledge-making more generally....Bod's energetic initiatives are a fine example of the shifting categories of research"--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Too often humanities scholars believe that they are moving toward science when they use empirical methods, Bod reflected. They are wrong: humanities scholars using empirical methods are returning to their own historical roots in the studia humanitatis of the 15th century, when the empirical approach was first invented."--Michael Shermer, <em>Scientific American</em><p></p><br>"The <em>telos</em> of his book is not just to write a story, but to make a case for the humanities as a discipline of progress"--Seth Lehrer, <em>Postmedieval: A Journal of Medieval Cultural Studies</em><p></p><br>"Bod's work did create a big sensation not only in the academic scene but also in the public and major newspapers in the Netherlands, England, and more generally Western Europe. Not only did he accomplish something that has not been done before, namely, a written history of the humanities, but he also takes a perspective to this enterprise that redefines the role of the humanities especially in relation to the natural sciences."--Oliver Glanz, <em>Seminary Studies</em><p></p><br>"Bod convincingly shows that since antiquity there have existed lines of humanistic investigation that have pursued the search for general laws governing the functioning of language, of texts or of history, very similar to the natural sciences."--Andrea Bonaccorsi, <em>Il Sole 24 Ore</em><p></p><br>"Bod takes the humanities back to their rightful place in the family tree of sciences."--Frederik Stjernfelt, <em>Weekendavisen</em>, Copenhagen [translated] <br><p></p><br>"Bod's effort has become a reason for debate and interdisciplinary encounters among different scholars who agree that the 'disunity' of the sciences, which is commonplace in the post-positivist epistemological era, does not necessarily mean disunity of culture."--Alesssandro Pagnini, <em>Domenica24</em> [translated] <br><p></p><br>"The current handwringing and doomsaying in academia concerning the study of humanities and its support, especially in the United States, makes Rens Bod's book not only an interesting read, but also timely and ambitious."--Dustin Mengelkoch, <em>Renaissance Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"In case anyone reading this review is not yet impressed, the author takes care, under each heading, to discuss developments not just in Europe but also (when appropriate) in India, China, and the civilization of Islam. The result is undeniably impressive--and hugely informative."--John Henry, <em>Isis</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Debating the Death Penalty: Should America Have Capital Punishment? The Experts on Both Sides Make Their Case</h2><p>When news breaks that a convicted murderer, released from prison, has killed again, or that an innocent person has escaped the death chamber in light of new DNA evidence, arguments about capital punishment inevitably heat up. Few controversies continue to stir as much emotion as this one, and public confusion is often the result.<br> This volume brings together seven experts--judges, lawyers, prosecutors, and philosophers--to debate the death penalty in a spirit of open inquiry and civil discussion. Here, as the contributors present their reasons for or against capital punishment, the multiple facets of the issue are revealed in clear and thought-provoking detail. Is the death penalty a viable deterrent to future crimes? Does the imposition of lesser penalties, such as life imprisonment, truly serve justice in cases of the worst offences? Does the legal system discriminate against poor or minority defendants? Is the possibility of executing innocent persons sufficient grounds for abolition?<br> In confronting such questions and making their arguments, the contributors marshal an impressive array of evidence, both statistical and from their own experiences working on death penalty cases. The book also includes the text of Governor George Ryan's March 2002 speech in which he explained why he had commuted the sentences of all prisoners on Illinois's death row.<br> By representing the viewpoints of experts who face the vexing questions about capital punishment on a daily basis, <em>Debating the Death Penalty</em> makes a vital contribution to a more nuanced understanding of the moral and legal problems underlying this controversy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Hugo Adam Bedau</strong> is Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Tufts University and editor of <em>The Death Penalty in America: Current Controversies.</em><br><strong>Paul Cassell</strong> is a U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Utah and Professor of Law at the University of Utah College of Law.<br>"From the commuting of death sentences to life imprisonment and the pardoning of four death-row prisoners last year by former Illinois governor George Ryan, the death penalty has now come front and center in American consciousness. This collection of essays presents a balanced discussion of<br>the range of issues associated with this debate, including the speech delivered by Ryan when he made his historic decision. The essayists include federal judges, lawyers, and philosophers. Four of the essays argue for the death penalty and four against. Contributors examine the key areas<br>concerning the death penalty: race and economics, the U.S. position on capital punishment in contrast to that of other nations, retribution and morality, the risks of wrongful convictions, the deterrence value of capital punishment, and closure for victims families. Contributors emphasize their own<br>particular points of view but add to an excellent overview of this life-and-death issue." --Booklist<br><br>"The controversies over capital punishment in the United States grow more heated each year, but there is very little discourse by public intellectuals on the meaning and legitimacy of death as a criminal punishment. This collection is an important attempt to fill that gap, to map out the key<br>questions in contention and the evidence available to answer them. It is a civilized and serious examination of a profoundly important fault line in the American legal system." --Franklin E. Zimring, William G. Simon Professor of Law, University of California, Berkeley, and author of The<br>Contradictions of American Capital Punishment<br><br>"At long last, an intelligent, well-reasoned debate and a much needed balanced discussion of this most serious and vexing issue in our system of criminal justice. Some of the most prominent and outspoken supporters and opponents of capital punishment get to have their say in a thoughtful and<br>reasoned discourse. At least, in this publication, supporters of capital punishment are given equal and appropriate treatment of their views on a subject most often swept under the rug or obscured by emotionalism."--Lynne Abraham, District Attorney of Philadelphia<br><br>"Brings fresh energy to an ongoing national conversation. It brings together some of the best thinkers and gets the best out of them. It contains up-to-date commentaries, all of which are lucid, engaging, and provocative. This book will be a singular resource for students of capital punishment<br>for years to come."--Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science, Amherst College<br><br>"It is not often that subtlety enters the death penalty debate in America. But Debating the Death Penalty achieves just that by bringing together the views of eight men who have very different ways of thinking about the subject. The book's most unique contribution is the way it reveals the<br>humanity and good faith of those who support the ultimate penalty; as they struggle with the gravity of their own conclusions, they remind us that our compassion and our duties as a civil society must flow toward the victim of crime as well as the accused."--Carla Main, Opinion Page Editor of The<br>National Law Journal</p><h2>Language Matters: A Guide to Everyday Questions About Language</h2><p>Is Ebonics really a dialect or simply bad English? Do women and men speak differently? Will computers ever really learn human language? Does offensive language harm children? These are only a few of the issues surrounding language that crop up every day. Most of us have very definite opinions on these questions one way or another. Yet as linguists Donna Jo Napoli and Vera Lee-Schoenfeld point out in this short and thoroughly readable volume, many of our most deeply held ideas about the nature of language and its role in our lives are either misconceived or influenced by myths and stereotypes.<br><br><em>Language Matters</em> provides a highly informative tour of the world of language, examining these and other vexing and controversial language-related questions. Throughout, Napoli and Lee-Schoenfeld encourage and lead the reader to use common-sense and everyday experience rather than preconceived notions or technical linguistic expertise. Both their questions and their conclusions are surprising, sometimes provocative, and always entertaining.<br><br>This thoroughly revised second edition updates the book with a new co-author, and includes new chapters on language and power, language extinction, and what it is linguists actually do. <em>Language Matters</em> is sure to engage both general readers and students of language and linguistics at any level.<br></p><p><br><strong>Donna Jo.

The author, David A. Freedman, explains the basic ideas of association and regression, and takes you through the current models that link these ideas to causality. The focus is on applications of linear models, including generalized least squares and two-stage least squares, with probits and logits for binary variables. The bootstrap is developed as a technique for estimating bias and computing standard errors. Careful attention is paid to the principles of statistical inference. There is background material on study design, bivariate regression, and matrix algebra. To develop technique, there are computer labs with sample computer programs. The book is rich in exercises, most with answers. Target audiences include advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in statistics, as well as students and professionals in the social and health sciences. The discussion in the book is organized around published studies, as are many of the exercises. Relevant journal articles are reprinted at the back of the book. Freedman makes a thorough appraisal of the statistical methods in these papers and in a variety of other examples. He illustrates the principles of modeling, and the pitfalls. The discussion shows you how to think about the critical issues - including the connection (or lack of it) between the statistical models and the real phenomena. Features of the book: � authoritative guidance from a well-known author with wide experience in teaching, research, and consulting � careful analysis of statistical issues in substantive applications � no-nonsense, direct style � versatile structure, enabling the text to be used as a text in a course, or read on its own � text that has been thoroughly class-tested at Berkeley � background material on regression and matrix algebra � plenty of exercises, most with solutions � extra material for instructors, including data sets and code for lab projects (available from Cambridge University Press) � many new exercises and examples � reorganized, restructured, and revised chapters to aid teaching and understanding</p><p>This lively and engaging textbook explains the things you have to know in order to read empirical papers in the social and health sciences, as well as the techniques you need to build statistical models of your own.

To his surprise, he finds that the road to the patient's disavowed experiences most frequently passes through the analyst's internal conversation, as multiple configurations of self-other interaction, previously dissociated, are set loose first in the analyst and then played out in the interpersonal field. <br><br>This insight leads to other discoveries. Beneath the dissociative structures seen in schizoid patients, and also in other personality disorders, Bromberg regularly finds traumatic experience -- even in patients not otherwise viewed as traumatized. This discovery allows interpersonal notions of psychic structure to emerge in a new light, as Bromberg arrives at the view that all severe character pathology masks dissociative defenses erected to ward off the internal experience of trauma and to keep the external world at bay to avoid retraumatization. These insights, in turn, open to a new understanding of dissociative processes as intrinsic to the therapeutic process per se. For Bromberg, it is the unanticipated eruption of the patient's relational world, with its push-pull impact on the analyst's effort to maintain a therapeutic stance, that makes possible the deepest and most therapeutically fruitful type of analytic experience. <br><br>Bromberg's essays are delightfully unpredictable, as they strive to keep the reader continually abreast of how words can and cannot capture the subtle shifts in relatedness that characterize the clinical process. Indeed, at times Bromberg's writing seems vividly to recreate the alternating states of mind of the relational analyst at work. Stirringly evocative in character and radiating clinical wisdom infused with compassion and wit, <i>Standing in the Spaces </i>is a classic destined to be read and reread by analysts and therapists for decades to come.</p><p><p>A preeminent writer on the understanding of trauma and dissociative phenomena, Philip M. Bromberg, Ph.D., is author of Standing in the Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma, and Dissociation (Analytic Press, 1998), Awakening the Dreamer: Clinical Journeys (Analytic Press, 2006), and The Shadow of the Tsunami: and the Growth of the Relational Mind (Routledge, 2011). He is Training and Supervising Analyst, William Alanson White Institute, and Adjunct Clinical Professor of Psychology, New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. Emeritus Co-Editor of Contemporary Psychoanalysis, Dr. Bromberg serves on the editorial boards of Psychoanalytic Dialogues and Psychoanalytic Inquiry. He lectures widely, and is actively involved in the training of mental health professionals nationally and internationally.</p><p><em>"Philip Bromberg's essays on psychoanalysis are unique jewels that derive from the convergence of two strikingly different sensibilities. On the one hand, Bromberg is an interpersonal analyst par excellence, with a plain-speaking forthrightness, a finely honed sense of the mutual impact of people upon each other, and a distaste for the abstractions of theorizing. On the other hand, he has a keen appreciation of the mostly deeply private domains of experience, the hidden recesses, the nuances of 'innerness' within which personal existence is preserved. This combination has generated a unique vision and finely textured conceptualization of the psychoanalytic process that captures, with both wit and warmth, some of its deepest contrasts: sameness and difference, safety and growth, the emotional contacts that make a deeply personal life possible and the immutably private.</em> Standing in the Spaces <em>makes available a body of work that is one of the finest achievements of contemporary pychoanalysis." </em><strong>- Stephen&nbsp;A. Mitchell, Ph.D., Author, <em>Relationality </em>(Analytic Press, 2000)</strong></p> <p><em>"Setting out to solve the riddle of meaning formation and therapeutic leverage, Bromberg presents a vivid and compelling new picture of the mind as more tenuously integrated than we had thought - a paradigm that sheds so much light on clinical phenomena and on the margin available for change that conflict theorists simply cannot ignore it. But Bromberg's greatest service is to reveal the high, technical dignity of those powerful forces that practitioners sensed in their bones but scorned as nonspecific and ungovernable, now orienting us to a more respectful and less impatient use of them. I predict that the impact of Bromberg's book will remain with the reader in every subsequent clinical encounter and rescue him in times of trouble." </em><strong>- Lawrence Friedman, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Weill Medical School, Cornell</strong></p> <p><em>"Every psychoanalyst and psychotherapist should read</em> Standing in the Spaces <em>in order to achieve a full understanding of what it is they do every day. The scholarship is remarkable; the style elegant and readable; the content imaginative, original, and wide-ranging; the clinical presentations tremendously evocative. The book is written from a predominantly interpersonalist perspective, but is masterly in the way it gathers in a wide range of ideas from other psychoanalytic orientations and beyond. Philip Bromberg is clearly an exceptionally gifted clinician as well as one of the outstanding theorists of our time."</em> <strong>- Peter Fonagy, Ph.D., Freud Memorial Professor, University College London</strong></p></p><h2>Perpetuating the Family Business: 50 Lessons Learned From Long Lasting, Successful Families in Business (A Family Business Publication)</h2><p>John L.

A land of astonishing natural beauty and a dizzying array of ancient cultures, the Caucasus for most of the twentieth century lay inside the Soviet Union, before movements of national liberation created newly independent countries and sparked the devastating war in Chechnya.<br><br>Combining riveting storytelling with insightful analysis, <em>The Ghost of Freedom</em> is the first general history of the modern Caucasus, stretching from the beginning of Russian imperial expansion up to the rise of new countries after the Soviet Union's collapse. In evocative and accessible prose, Charles King reveals how tsars, highlanders, revolutionaries, and adventurers have contributed to the fascinating history of this borderland, providing an indispensable guide to the complicated histories, politics, and cultures of this intriguing frontier. Based on new research in multiple languages, the book shows how the struggle for freedom in the mountains, hills, and plains of the Caucasus has been a perennial theme over the last two hundred years--a struggle which has led to liberation as well as to new forms of captivity. The book sheds valuable light on the origins of modern disputes, including the ongoing war in Chechnya, conflicts in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and debates over oil from the Caspian Sea and its impact on world markets.<br><br>Ranging from the salons of Russian writers to the circus sideshows of America, from the offices of European diplomats to the villages of Muslim mountaineers, <em>The Ghost of Freedom</em> paints a rich portrait of one of the world's most turbulent and least understood regions.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charles King</strong> is Ion Ratiu Professor of Romanian Studies, Professor of International Affairs, and Professor of Government at Georgetown University.

Enlivened by compelling anecdotes, colorful characters, and first-hand reportage that bring the Caucasus to life, this remarkable book is a highly original and beautifully written analysis of the forces that have shaped the region, from a whirlwind of imperial conquest and nation-building to Soviet engineering, mass deportations, and the bitter consequences of imperial collapse: ethnic wars, banditry, refugees, and misrule. It is an indispensable guide to the Caucasus--and to contemporary global affairs."--Robert D. Crews, author of <em>For Prophet and Tsar: Islam and Empire in Russia and Central Asia</em><p></p><br>"This is a rare work with something for all readers...King's ability to tease out the broader historical patterns in all their complexities and subtleties is remarkable. At the same time, he possesses the sort of keen eye for detail and telling stories that bring the region truly to life in all its vibrant color."--<em>Europe: Early Modern and Modern</em><p></p><br>"King has produced a work that is remarkable for its breadth of coverage, the depth of the author's insights, and the eloquence of the text.

Will Count Olaf prevail? Will the Baudelaires survive? Will the series end happily? If there&#39;s nothing out there, what was that noise?</p><p>Picking up from the final pages of the <i>Pentultimate Peril</i>, this farewell installment to the ridiculously (and deservedly!) popular A Series of Unfortunate Events places our protagonists right where we last left them: on a large, wooden boat in the middle of the ocean, trapped with their nemesis Count Olaf, who has armed himself with a helmet-full of deadly Medusoid Mycelium.<p> The situation quickly and--this being the Baudelaires--predictably deteriorates. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny find themselves tossed in a storm so terrible that our beloved narrator spends four pages describing how he cannot describe it. From this point on, fans of the series' smarty-pants wordplay and acrobatic narrative can rest assured that they're in for more of the same (and how) in this 368-page finale, and Daniel Handler's deadpan Snicket continues to tutor a generation in self-referential humor (including one particularly funny bit regarding three very short men carrying a large, flat piece of wood, painted to look like a living room). Snicket notes, of course, that if you read the entire series, "your only reward will be 170 chapters of misery in your library and countless tears in your eyes."</p><p> There's one big question, though, for anyone who's made it through "the thirteenth chapter of the thirteenth volume in this sad history": is the final book a fitting end? That question is probably best-answered by one of <i>The End</i>'s most oft-repeated phrases: It depends on how you look at it. Those looking for conclusive resolution to the series' many, many mysteries may be disappointed, although some big questions do get explicit answers. Not surprisingly for a work so deliberately labyrinthine, though, even the absence of an answer can be sort of an answer--and reaction to <i>The End</i> can be something of a Rorschach test for readers. Or, as Lemony Snicket says, "Perhaps you don&#x2019;t know yet what the end really means." <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>Like an off-key violin concert, the Roman Empire, or food poisoning, all things must come to an end. Thankfully, this includes A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. The thirteenth and final installment in the groundbreaking series will answer readers&#x2032; most burning questions: Will Count Olaf prevail? Will the Baudelaires survive? Will the series end happily? If there&#x2032;s nothing out there, what was that noise? </p><p> Then again, why trouble yourself with unfortunate resolutions?

Each of us is the product of all the stories we have ever heard-and of many of which we are unaware. These stories shape how we see ourselves, the world, and our place in it. The first great storytellers in our lives are home, school, popular culture, and, perhaps, church. Knowing and embracing healthy stories are crucial to living rightly and well.This book investigates the relationship between stories and meaning in life, the difference between character and personality, the ability of story to make connections between things, the power of story to bring about a desired future, how stories create community and a sense of belonging, and how broken stories can be healed.The book is rooted in psychological, literary, and theological research into the nature of story, but is written in a personal, engaging voice. It includes a series of questions designed to help readers identify the important stories in their own lives.</p><p>Daniel Taylor, professor of literature at Bethel University (Minnesota), has written six books, including The Myth of Certainty, Letters to My Children, and In Search of Sacred Places. Dr. Taylor is co-founder of The Legacy Center, an organization devoted to helping individuals preserve their stories and values, and a contributing editor of Books and Culture. Speaks frequently.Although the title implies a self-help book, this is no pop psychology how-to but an old-fashioned moral essay that speaks of character and values. Taylor (English/Bethel College; Letters to My Children, not reviewed) believes that stories make it possible for us to be human; they ``tell us who we are, why we are here, and what we are doing.'' We learn them as family stories and as school and religious lessons; strangers surround us with their stories on television, in movies, and in books and magazines; and we tell our own stories about ourselves. They preserve our memories, explain our present, and help us imagine our future. With tales such as Huckleberry Finn, Taylor illustrates how exposure to characters in stories helps to mold one's own character, and using Elie Wiesel's memoir Night, he demonstrates how stories shape one's view of the world. They teach us that character is more important than personality, and they challenge us to be characters engaged in life, not simply passive spectators. The values of every human society are captured in its stories, says Taylor, and to be civilized is to internalize those values; thus we are defined by our stories and by the stories we choose to tell our children. The healing power of stories, he says, comes from their power to reconnect us with others, for a story implies a community of at least two, a teller and a listener, each with responsibilities to the other. An appendix includes questions about readers' own stories; in answering the questions, says Taylor, readers will find better understanding not only of the stories but of themselves.

Even if we sense a deeper meaning, we are generally unable to say what a dream symbolises or see its connection to the important aspects of our everyday life. The Tibetan Art of Dream Analysis reveals how for over a thousand years Tibetan dream masters have been able to see the deep link between the dream world and the waking one. Through them we understand why nightly dreams can give clear signs of health warnings, conflicts, or foretell events yet to happen such as death, a birth, or other harbingers of wealth and happiness. This book provides a useful list of dream symbols and their hidden meanings as well as case studies of easy to read analyses of dreams. Those interested in going beyond merely understanding what a dream might mean will find, within its pages, very detailed, step-by-step approaches as practised by dream yoga masters long ago. For the truly committed this book holds out the ultimate goal of spiritual enlightenment for someone prepared to undertake the rigorous journey of an adept dream yoga practitioner.</p><p></p><h2>The Cat Lover&#39;s Craft Book: Cute and Easy Accessories for Kitty&#39;s Best Friend</h2><p><b>Unleash Your Inner Crazy Craft Lady!</b><br><br>Here a cat there a cat, everywhere a crafted cat!

With a wide and enthusiastic ecumenical audience, she is much in demand for retreats, conferences, diocesan conventions, and clergy days. </p> <p>In her new book, Guenther retells the "walking stories" of Scripture and unpacks the truths they reveal about spiritual life: Jesus walks everywhere with his disciples -- always arriving, departing, on the way somewhere else. Adam and Eve walked out of the garden, Lot and his daughters walked out of Sodom, Abraham and Isaac walked to Mt. Moriah, the Israelites walked for forty years to the promised land, the Prodigal Son walked home barefoot, the disciples walked to Emmaus. </p> <p>The spiritual life is oftentimes about putting one foot in front of another, always on the way, never home, until crossing another new threshold. However, the point of all our walking -- whether tedious or joyous, rambling or goal-oriented -- is getting home, as this splendid author illustrates in this reflective new work. </p></p><p>Margaret Guenther&#39;s books on the spiritual life have found an appreciative, wide audience.

Archaeologist Jeannine Davis-Kimball, in <i>Warrior Women</i>, an account of her digs at burial sites of Eurasian nomads, finds it an embellishment of the former. But, she posits, women's place in that world was generally more exalted than previously thought.<p> Nearly one-quarter of the women buried in some late Iron Age sites were either warriors or priestesses. Even the remainder, "hearth women," were important players in the tribes' surprisingly egalitarian societies. Further, southern Kazakhstan's famous "gold man" was in fact, a "gold woman." Davis-Kimball also finds solid evidence of "high status" women in graves as far east as China and as far west as Ireland.</p><p> <i>Warrior Women</i> is, thankfully, free of lazy sensationalism. But it is frustratingly organized, with little regard to either chronology or geography. Further, Davis-Kimball never places her finds in any sort of context, be it popular or scholarly. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i></p>Davis-Kimball was a mother of 6 and a nurse before earning her PhD in Archaelogy and Art History from Berkeley.She has made numerous scientific discoveries about gender culture.</p><h2>Small World</h2><p>Philip Swallow, Morris Zapp, Persse McGarrigle and the lovely Angelica are the jet-propelled academics who are on the move, in the air and on the make in David Lodge&#x2019;s satirical&nbsp;<i>Small World</i>.

Several lines of evidence, most recently genetic, have firmly established that all Native American populations originated in eastern Siberia. </p><p> For many years, the accepted version of New World prehistory held that people arrived in the Western Hemisphere around 13,000 years ago. This consensus, called "Clovis First," has been increasingly challenged by discoveries at numerous archaeological sites throughout North and South America and is now widely considered to be outdated. </p><p> The latest findings have convinced most archaeologists that people came to the Western Hemisphere thousands of years prior to Clovis. There is credible evidence of a human presence in the Americas dating to 19,000 years ago and perhaps as early as 38,000 years ago. The prehistory of the very earliest arrivals into the New World is the subject of <i>Strangers in a New Land</i>. </p><p> This book documents 35 Clovis and Folsom sites, disputed pre-Clovis sites, legitimate pre-Clovis sites and controversial pre-Clovis sites. This covers an area that stretches from Bluefish Cave, Canada, 70 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle to Monte Verde, Chile, 14,000 kilometers south of Bering Straits.

Folsom also serves as the complex's type site, defined by the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> as "the site where objects or materials regarded as defining the characteristics of a particular period were found." The Folsom complex was a cultural manifestation that endured for about 700 years and whose range extended from the Rocky Mountains to the central Great Plains, from central Texas to just south of the Canadian border. </p><p> The Folsom site is located in the northeastern corner of New Mexico near the Colorado border, about 15 kilometers west of the village of Folsom and about 200 kilometers northeast of Santa Fe, on the southwestern reaches of the Great Plains about 100 kilometers east of the Rocky Mountains. The site lies principally on the southern bank of Wild Horse Arroyo (also known as Dead Horse Arroyo), a narrow, ephemeral tributary of the Dry Cimarron River which in turn is a tributary of the Arkansas River and, ultimately, the Mississippi. The regional physiography is dominated by volcanic landforms and large flat-topped mesas that are divided by several major river systems and interspersed with grasslands and open woodlands. [Figure 1.1] The river valleys generally trend from west to east and, along with several mountain passes currently used by modern highways, would have provided ready human and animal access to the region from the High Plains to the east. </p><p> During Folsom times, the climate appears to have been drier and cooler than today with fairly snowy winters. Although tree species were probably similar to those present today, it appears that vegetation was more open with abundant grass- and shrub-covered parkland, scattered wetlands, ponds, and lakes. These conditions would have made the region attractive to bison, but apart from the prospects for hunting, not altogether attractive to humans. There were no sources for nearby toolstone, few springs, and few edible plants to distinguish the site's immediate area from adjacent, more ecologically diverse places. The site's attraction, in other words, was primarily its position in a landscape dominated by a topography that helped to channel people and animals around impassable, steeper areas such as mesas and volcanoes. </p><p> The Folsom site is widely believed to have been discovered by a cowboy named George McJunkin sometime after a destructive and deadly 1908 flash flood of Wild Horse Arroyo exposed bison bones on the eroded arroyo floor. [Figure 1.2] The site had remained known only to avocational naturalists until early in 1926, when Jesse Dade Figgins and Harold Cook of the Colorado Museum of Natural History in Denver visited the site in the interest of recovering a bison skeleton for display. After about a month's excavation, this presumed exclusively paleontological site became an archaeological locality with the discovery of a Folsom point, followed by a second point a month after that. Neither of these artifacts was found actually embedded in bison remains. Upon presenting Smithsonian curator Ales Hrdlicka with his finds in early 1927, Figgins was advised that he should halt excavation and invite the inspection of "outside scientists" to confirm the recovery of any embedded (and therefore indisputably associated) artifacts that might be encountered in the future. </p><p> Several Folsom points embedded between the ribs of extinct bison were subsequently recovered from the site during the 1927 and 1928 field seasons (the latter conducted in collaboration between the Colorado Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History). Visits by elite scholars ultimately confirmed the site as, minimally, a very Late Pleistocene bison kill. [Figures 1.3 and 1.4] But some significant questions remained. In the absence of radiocarbon dating, which would not be available for another twenty years, the site's age remained unknown and only broad estimates (ranging from "thousands of years" old to 20,000-15,000 yr BP) could made by the excavators. Additionally, because the excavation methods of the time employed only very crude measurement techniques and the project was primarily focused on removal of the bones rather than precisely documenting the site, the lay of the land at the time of the site's formation also remained unknown. [Figure 1.5] Had the site been a streambed, marsh, pond, lake during the Late Pleistocene? No one could say. </p><p> Despite its international acclaim and pivotal role in a watershed moment of American archaeology, the Folsom site remained curiously absent from scholarly publications following the brief flourish of mostly superficial treatments that appeared immediately after its discovery. The reporting of subsequently discovered Folsom sites--there are now at least forty-five localities recorded on the Great Plains and in the Rocky Mountains--had essentially eclipsed the type site until 1997, when archaeologists at Southern Methodist University in Dallas returned to the site with a major multidisciplinary research project. </p><p> The Southern Methodist University work was conducted over the course of three field seasons (1997-1999), periodic brief site visits thereafter (2000-2004), and several years of laboratory investigations, culminating in the publication of an outstanding monograph in 2006, <i>Folsom: New Archaeological Investigations of a Classic Paleoindian Bison Kill</i>. The project team, led by David Meltzer, sought to (1) determine whether intact bone deposits remained, (2) determine whether a Folsom-age camp or habitation site was present, and (3) elucidate the site's stratigraphy, chronology, and paleoenvironment. The project also sought to integrate its approach, methods, and findings with those carried out at the site some seventy years earlier and by Vance Haynes and his colleagues in the 1970s under the auspices of the Folsom Ecology Project. Newly excavated portions of the site covered about 375 square meters over the course of the Southern Methodist University project, and questions concerning the site's stratigraphy and formation were addressed via extensive sedimentological coring, augering, and geophysical studies. </p><p> The new work at the site demonstrated that the Folsom site landscape had undergone considerable geological alteration since late glacial times, and that a thick layer of more-recent sediments overlays and masks the former Late Pleistocene landscape. [Figure 1.6] The site's stratigraphy is composed of three discrete formations which include, from top to bottom, the Wildhorse (a relatively thin, recent deposit that is no older than 700 years), the McJunkin (a 2-meter thick Holocene deposit that dates from about 7950-7580 yr BP to 5320-4860 yr BP), and the Folsom (a 2-meter thick Holocene through Late Pleistocene deposit that dates from about 15,150-13,790 yr BP to 10,510- 10,250 yr BP). The bison bones and Folsom artifacts recovered from the site occurred within the middle of three Folsom formation subdivisions, named f2, which was radiocarbon dated to an unhelpfully broad range of about 13,440-13,270 yr BP to 11,720-11,280 yr BP, a span which is about three times the presently known duration of the Folsom complex. </p><p> Obtaining a more precise date for of the Folsom-age bone bed within the f2 deposit was partly achieved by modeling the site's topography as it appeared in the Late Pleistocene.

Opposed to it is a countervailing narrative of a world claimed by a God who is gracious, uncompromising - and real. In previous work Brueggemann has pointed us again and again to the indispensability of imagination. Here he writes for those who bear responsibility for regular proclamation in communities of faith, describing the discipline of a prophetic imagination that is unflinchingly realistic and unwaveringly candid.</p><p>Walter Brueggemann is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament Emeritus at Columbia Theological Seminary and the author of numerous books including, from Fortress Press, The Prophetic Imagination, rev. ed. (2001); The Word Militant: Preaching a Decentering Word (2007); and Like Fire in the Bones: Listening for the Prophetic Word in Jeremiah (2006).&#34;Walter Brueggemann&#39;s early work on prophecy and imagination has become foundational for a whole generation of preachers and scholars, including me. Here he returns to perhaps the most characteristic of all his myriad ventures, with unaltered vigor and razor-sharp edge. Prophets are not just provocateurs: they are those who profoundly love their people, deeply know their tradition, and can&#39;t but speak of what they both love and know. Brueggemann both loves and knows. That&#39;s what makes him a prophet. Would that we were more like him. Reading this book is a healthy first step.&#34; --Sam Wells, Duke University</p><h2>Prison Industrial Complex For Beginners</h2><p><p><i>Prison Industrial Complex For Beginners</i> is a graphic narrative project that attempts to distill the fundamental components of what scholars, activists, and artists have identified as the Mass Incarceration movement in the United States.</p><p>Since the early 1990s, activist critics of the US prison system have marked its emergence as a &#x201c;complex&#x201d; in a manner comparable to how President Eisenhower described the Military Industrial Complex. Like its institutional &#x201c;cousin,&#x201d; the Prison Industrial Complex features a critical combination of political ideology, far-reaching federal policy, and the neo-liberal directive to privatize institutions traditionally within the purview of the government. The result is that corporations have capital incentives to capture and contain human bodies.</p><p>The Prison Industrial Complex relies on the &#x201c;law and order&#x201d; ideology fomented by President Nixon and developed at least partially in response to the unrest generated through the Civil Rights Movement. It is (and has been) enhanced and emboldened via the US &#x201c;war on drugs,&#x201d; a slate of policies that by any account have failed to do anything except normalize the warehousing of nonviolent substance abusers in jails and prisons that serve more as criminal training centers then as redemptive spaces for citizens who might re-enter society successfully.</p><p><i>Prison Industrial Complex For Beginners</i> is a primer for how these issues emerged and how our awareness of the systems at work in mass incarceration might be the very first step in reforming an institution responsible for some of our most egregious contemporary civil rights violations.</p></p><p><b>James Braxton Peterson</b> is Director of Africana Studies and Associate Professor of English at Lehigh University.

Born in India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.&#34;Yogananda was a God-filled seer and saint, philosopher and poet who experienced a multitude of the innumerable aspects of Ultimate Reality. Compact, vivid, and beautiful meditations convey to readers his rich experiences of joy.&#34; -- Raymond F.

Unlike their geisha counterparts, courtesans didn't lived in brothels or bend their wills to suit their suitors. They were the muses who enflamed the hearts of our most celebrated artists--Raphael, Manet, Dumas, and Proust, to name just a few--as well as becoming artists in their own right. Offering the first comprehensive tour of their worlds, Susan Griffins celebrates these first feminists and hails their virtues: Timing, Beauty, Cheek, Brilliance, Gaiety, Grace, and Charm. <br><br>From Veronica Franco, who graced the palazzos of sixteenth-century Venice, and Madame de Pompadour, the arbiter of all things fashionable at Versailles during the reign of Lous XV, to La Belle Otero of the grand boulevards of Paris in the Gay Nineties and Marion Davies, who took Hollywood by storm in the 1920's and 1930's, <i>The Book of the Courtesans</i> enticingly illustrates the intricacies of their lavish lifestyles and incredible life stories. Fascinating true tales and enlightening snippets from courtesans' memoirs further reveal how these cunning women seized their opportunity to become the West's first liberators, free to choose their own lovers and command remarkable respect.<br><br>Delving into his scintillating world, <i>The Book of the Courtesans</i> is an impeccably researched, beautifully crafted portrait of some of the most intriguing figures in women's history.</p><p>Poet and writer Susan Griffin is famously provocative, though her provocation takes very different forms, ranging from her classic feminist treatise, <i>Women and Nature</i>, which linked patriarchy with the oppression of women and nature, to her well-received <i>A Chorus of Stones</i>, which weighed in on the nature of war. But in <i>The Book of Courtesans</i>, Griffin is downright scintillating. Courtesans, she writes, were not prostitutes nor even kept women, though certainly they used their sexuality to financial gain. Rather, they were personages and celebrities, friends to royalty and the most famous writers and artists of their time, the subjects of gossip, the charismatic epicenter of the Second Empire, the Gay Nineties, the Belle Epoche, "Gay Paree." Their faces were immortalized in paintings by the Renaissance masters, by Degas, Renoir, and Toulouse-Lautrec, their lives by Proust, Balzac, Zola, Flaubert. They lived in splendor, set fashion standards, owned fabulous jewelry collections. And they were talented authors, poets, actresses, and singers. In a time of prescribed roles for women, they turned the tables, creating lives of remarkable intellectual and financial freedom. <p> Griffin sings the praises of these women and enunciates their virtues, which, ironically, are the sort popularly thought to be made anachronistic by feminism. With her impeccable timing, the French dancer Mogador achieved legendary status the first time she danced on stage and later became a countess. Harriet Wilson seduced the Duke of Wellington with her cheek, and delivered him from boredom. Marion Davies' gaiety enlivened all those who saw her, Madame Pompadour was the embodiment of grace, and Sarah Bernhardt exuded so much charm she acted her way straight out of the role of courtesan. Griffin imagines herself into her subjects lives with sensitivity and sensuality--the rags to riches stories that characterized them and their creative responses to often dire circumstances. In the end, she not only immortalizes these feminist precursors, but reminds us that "the capacity to take pleasure in life is no less a virtue than any other." <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>"Provocative and compelling, filled with Susan Griffin's typically wise and beautiful writing, <i>The Book of The Courtesans</i> rescues from near oblivian some of history's most outrageous and audacious women."<br>--Alice Walker, author of <i>The Color Purple</i></p><h2>The Art of Arthur Rackham: Celebrating 150 Years of the Great British Artist: Celebrating 150 Years of the Great British Artist</h2><p><p><strong>To celebrate one </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>the best artists in British history Pook Press has compiled 150 of Arthur Rackham's best illustrations in one beautiful volume.&nbsp; </strong></p><p>2017 marks the 150th birthday of Arthur Rackham, the best illustrator of the Edwardian era.

Ford Professor of the History of Science and faculty dean of Pforzheimer House at Harvard University. She is the author of four books, including Mind Fixers and The Cure Within. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Starred Review. Over the past several years, numerous medical reports have confirmed the connection between a positive mental attitude and good physical health. In this splendid book, Harrington (The Placebo Effect), chair of Harvard's history of science department, demonstrates that the belief in such a connection between mind and body is nothing new. She uses case studies and stories of healings to show how deeply embedded the idea of positive mental health is in the quest for physical health, as well as the ways that contemporary medicine has incorporated a focus on mind-body healing into its black bag. In her highly original analysis of this history from ancient times to the present, she discovers six different narratives about mind-body healing. These include the power of suggestion, the power of positive thinking and broken by modern life. In the body that speaks narrative, for instance, Harrington traces the idea that physical symptoms are the outward expression of the mind's secrets, and that revealing those secrets can heal, whether the revelation takes place in the confession box or on the analyst's couch. Harrington's study offers a first-rate cultural history of an age-old but still much debated topic. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1935, however, a descendant of one of the old Spanish land-grant families in the region&#x2014;a woman, no less&#x2014;found an ingenious way to publish the history of her region at a time when neither Tejanos nor women had much voice. She told the story from the perspective of an ancient mesquite tree, under whose branches much South Texas history had passed. Her tale became an invaluable source of folk history but has long been out of print. Now, with important new introductions by Leticia M. Garza-Falc�n and Andr�s Tijerina, the history witnessed by El Mesquite can again inform readers of the way of life that first shaped Texas. Through the voice of the gnarled old tree, Elena Zamora O'Shea tells South Texas political and ethnographic history, filled with details of daily life such as songs, local plants and folk medicines, foods and recipes, peone/patron relations, and the Tejano ranch vocabulary. The work is an important example of the historical-folkloristic literary genre used by Mexican American writers of the period. Using the literary device of the tree's narration, O'Shea raises issues of culture, discrimination, and prejudice she could not have addressed in her own voice in that day and explicitly states the Mexican American ideology of 1930s Texas. The result is a literary and historic work of lasting value, which clearly articulates the Tejano claim to legitimacy in Texas history.</p><p>ELENA ZAMORA O'SHEA (1880&#x2013;1951) was born at Rancho La Noria Cardenena near Pe�itas, Hidalgo County, Texas. A long-time schoolteacher, whose posts included one on the famous King Ranch, she wrote this book to help Tejano children know and claim their proud heritage.&#x201c;. . . the mesquite narratively guides us through a considerable amount of Texas history . . . engaging, lively at moments, serious at others and well-written.&#x201d;--Jos� E.

This book, an improved edition of a Russian classic, teaches amateur chess players 45 extremely effective skills in a crystal-clear manner.<br><br>Quite a few of the ideas presented here will surprise the reader, because they offer solutions for problems the club player is only subconsciously aware. How do you activate your rook pawn? How do you prevent your opponent from opening a file? How do you restrict the efficacy of your opponents pieces? Which rook belongs on the c-, d- or e-file? What is the best way to exchange a piece? How do you castle artificially?<br>In most cases the techniques are easy to understand and memorize.

His evocations of small-town Pennsylvania life, and of his own religious, artistic, and sexual awakening, transfixed readers of <i>The New Yorker</i> and of the early collections <i>Pigeon Feathers</i> (1962) and <i>The Music School</i> (1966). In these and the works that followed&#x2014;the formal experiments and wickedly tart tales of suburban adultery in <i>Museums and Women</i> (1972) and <i>Problems</i> (1979), the portraits of middle-aged couples in love and at war with aging parents and rebellious children in <i>Trust Me</i> (1987) and <i>The Afterlife</i> (1994), and the fugue-like stories of memory, desire, travel, and unquenched thirst for life in <i>Licks of Love</i> (2000) and <i>My Father&#x2019;s Tears</i> (2009)&#x2014;Updike displayed the virtuosic command of character, dialogue, and sensual description that was his signature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here, in two career-spanning volumes, are 186 unforgettable stories, from &#x201c;Ace in the Hole&#x201d; (1953), a sketch of a Rabbit-like ex-basketball player written when Updike was a Harvard senior, to &#x201c;The Full Glass&#x201d; (2008), the author&#x2019;s &#x201c;toast to the visible world, his own impending disappearance from it be damned.&#x201d; Based on new archival research, each story is presented in its final definitive form and in order of composition, established here for the first time.

And yet, our companions in evolution are leaving the world &#x2014; both as physical beings and spiritual symbols &#x2014; and not returning. In this collection of linked essays, Alison Hawthorne Deming asks, and seeks to answer: what does the disappearance of animals mean for human imagination and existence? Moving from mammoth hunts to dying house cats, she explores profound questions about what it means to be animal. What is inherent in animals that leads us to destroy, and what that leads us toward peace? As human animals, how does art both define us as a species and how does it emerge primarily from our relationship with other species? The reader emerges with a transformed sense of how the living world around us has defined and continues to define us in a powerful way.</p><p><b>Alison Hawthorne Deming</b> is the Winner of the Walt Whitman Award, finalist for the PEN Center West Award, and a former Stegner Fellow.

Each rose, seized lands in the ancient Near East, and then declined to insignificance. It was only the third empire, the Neo-Assyrian Empire, that finally attained the full size and scope which previous rulers had attempted. Yet the very size of the empire was part of what eventually led to its downfall. Internal dissent and civil wars weakened the empire to the point that it was not able to exercise effective control over the lands it had conquered.

When the media horde begins baying for political blood Jack&#39;s friends rally round to protect him. But some of those friends - particularly his wife&#39;s associates - are not so squeaky clean themselves.</p><p>Born in the Kingdom of Fife in 1960, Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982, and then spent three years writing novels when he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish Literature. His first Rebus novel was published in 1987, and the Rebus books are now translated into thirty-six languages and are bestsellers worldwide.Ian Rankin has been elected a Hawthornden Fellow, and is also a past winner of the Chandler-Fulbright Award. He is the recipient of four CWA Daggers including the prestigious Diamond Dagger in 2005. In 2004, Ian won America&#39;s celebrated Edgar Award. He has also been shortlisted for the Anthony Award in the USA, won Denmark&#39;s Palle Rosenkrantz Prize, the French Grand Prix du Roman Noir and the Deutscher Krimipreis. Ian Rankin is also the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Hull and the Open University.A contributor to BBC2&#39;s Newsnight Review, he also presented his own TV series, Ian Rankin&#39;s Evil Thoughts. Rankin is a No.1 bestseller in the UK and has received the OBE for services to literature, opting to receive the prize in his home city of Edinburgh, where he lives with his partner and two sons. www.ianrankin.net Twitter @BeathhighFor all the right reasons, Edinburgh Detective Inspector John Rebus calls for comparison with Colin Dexter's Oxford copper Inspector Morse. Both spend a lot of time in pubs and bemoan the onset of middle age; each is a shrewd detective with a literary bent who operates in an academic town where clashes of culture beget victims. When much-loved politician Gregor Jack is discovered in a midnight raid on a discreet brothel, a surprising number of journalists are on hand--a situation that endangers Jack's political future. Jack's wealthy wife Elizabeth, a noted partygoer whose friends are equally well-heeled and hedonistic, can't be found. Her body is soon pulled from a nearby river, a fatality mirroring the recent murder of another, unidentified, woman. A drunk who brags of the first killing gives a false address and vanishes north of the city. Meanwhile Rebus, trying to trace a cache of valuable stolen books, finds himself talking again to the late Elizabeth's coterie of party friends. Rankin creates a living, breathing world in which his weary protagonist tackles his cases while involved in the intricacies of the day-to-day: pints and hangovers, stumbling romance, wet weather, damp clothes, tricky superiors and wide-eyed subordinates. All are brought to bear, yet all are ultimately jettisoned as Rebus closes in on the satisfying solution. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mirror, Shoulder, Signal: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A smart, witty novel of driving lessons and vertigo, short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize</b></p><p>Sonja is ready to get on with her life.

Drawing on biblical truths, historical writings, and modern examples they ask, &#x201c;What does the cross have to tell us about the art of living a fully human life? What if the things we&#x2019;re most afraid of are the pathway to freedom? What if the way of humility and suffering gives us peace in a way our successes never could?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Cross Before Me </i>is for anyone who wonders what the shape of Jesus&#x2019; life has to teach us about finding the life Jesus promises. This unique book helps readers reimagine the good life as they learn to delight in releasing power and embracing the cross as the only path to human flourishing.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Rankin Wilbourne</b>&nbsp;is senior pastor of Pacific Crossroads Church in Los Angeles and the author of&nbsp;<i>Union with Christ</i>.

The Cross Before Me is a lucid, learned, life-changing guide along the upside-down journey to human flourishing. It will inspire and enlighten anyone who dwells in the words.&#x201d;</p> (John Ortberg, senior pastor, Menlo Church; author of Eternity Is Now in Session)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is an urgent and challenging yet ultimately hopeful book. I know it&#x2019;s going to help others the way it encouraged me to find life in the way of the cross. Wilbourne and Gregor know that Jesus&#x2019; way isn&#x2019;t popular today. But I&#x2019;m so thankful they&#x2019;ve shown us the truth about abundant life.&#x201d;</p> (Collin Hansen, editorial director of The Gospel Coalition)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Rankin and Brian have an uncanny ability to explain deep, complicated truths in a way that almost anyone can understand. The rare combination of intellect and accessibility that they possess shines in this wonderful book. They expand our vision for how the cross not only secures our pardon, but also establishes for us a pattern of life that will lead to freedom and flourishing.&#x201d;</p> (Scott Sauls, pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church, Nashville)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In this extraordinarily perceptive and powerful book, pastor and philosopher show us how the way of the cross is, surprisingly, the way of life, happiness, and communion with God. I firmly believe that the faithfulness of everyday Christians, the renewal of the church, and the flourishing of humanity depend on taking the sorts of insights and examples found in this book with the utmost seriousness&#x2014;by embracing them as a way of life.&#x201d;</p> (Michael J. Gorman, professor of biblical studies and theology)<br><br>&#x201c;There is a door that each person longs to walk through: the door to happiness. But that door has a lock. The key to that lock has a stunningly simple shape: the shape of the cross. This key was forged in the fires of Jesus&#x2019; suffering and death, and polished by the glory of his resurrection. This book explains how to take hold of that (Ken Sande, author of The Peacemaker; founder of Peacemaker Ministries)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In a culture of self-expression and radical individualism, Wilbourne and Gregor offer a counterintuitive yet deeply meaningful message: God&#x2019;s way of human flourishing is through a cross-shaped life. Christ&#x2019;s death on the cross is not only the key moment of our conversion, but it has the power to reform all of life. This book is profound, practical, and provides a much-needed paradigm shift for followers of Jesus. I highly recommend it.&#x201d;</p> (Jeremy Treat, PhD, author; pastor; adjunct professor of theology)<br><br><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t find slogans like &#x2018;Happiness is following Jesus&#x2019; way of the cross&#x2019; in contemporary culture. The idea that to save our lives we first must lose them is as counterintuitive and countercultural in our time as it was in Jesus&#x2019;. Wilbourne and Gregor rightly remind us that the cross is not simply the event at the end of Jesus&#x2019; story but the mark that characterizes his whole life, revealing God as self-giving, cruciform love. I&#x2019;m delighted that a pastor and a philosopher have pooled their resources to make this compelling case for the wisdom of viewing all of life in light of the cross. This is an urgent appeal for rethinking everything we value through the lens of cruciformity.&#x201d;</p> (Kevin J. Vanhoozer, research professor of systematic theology)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The Cross Before Me&nbsp;heralds the upside-down wisdom of the cross&#x2014;a paradox meant for settling into the marrow of our lives and forming us into the image of Jesus. But it&#x2019;s not enough to think&nbsp;of the cross, the authors remind. Rather, if we&#x2019;re to be led into God&#x2019;s enduring joy, the glorious shadow of the cross must fall over every square inch of our longings and ambitions, hopes and dreams. Rarely do books cover as much important, theological ground as this one, which makes it a delight for me to recommend.&#x201d;</p> (Jen Pollock Michel, author of Surprised by Paradox)<br><br><p>The desire for happiness is universal. We all want happiness. And yet we just can&#x2019;t seem to possess it.&nbsp; Maybe it&#x2019;s time to take another route, a cross shaped route.&nbsp; Rankin Wilbourne and Brian Gregor winsomely point us to the only true way to happiness, a way that necessitates death in order to truly be fully alive, to be truly happy.&#x201d;</p> (Bryan Loritts, pastor; author of Insider Outsider)<br><br><p>&#x201c;I love this book! The Cross Before Me<i></i>brings the reader on an extraordinary journey. Accessible yet deep, it invites readers into the wondrous caverns of Scripture and the Christian tradition in articulating a much-needed word to today&#x2019;s church: if you want to flourish, pursue the way of the cross in Jesus Christ. The message is counterintuitive but true. Beautifully written, Wilbourne and Gregor make this case by drawing together a colorful tapestry of voices from literature, philosophy, theology, and popular culture.

Also revealed are the mathematical foundations for the moon landing, airplane travel, the electric generator -- and even life itself. </p><p>Praised by <em>Publishers Weekly</em> as "a wholly accessible, beautifully written exploration of the potent mathematical imagination," and named a Best Nonfiction Book of 1995, the stories behind <strong>The Five Equations That Changed the World</strong>, as told by Dr. Guillen, are not only chronicles of science, but also gripping dramas of jealousy, fame, war, and discovery.</p></p><p>Dr. Michael Guillen is an instructor of physics and mathematics in the Core Curriculum Program at Harvard University.Take one part each of natural philosophy, biography, and historical novel, mix together, and you have this adventure through two centuries of changing scientific thought. Guillen chooses Newton's universal law of gravitation, Bernoulli's law of fluid flow pressure, Faraday's law relating electricity and magnetism, Clausius' law of constantly increasing entropy, and Einstein's law relating mass and energy, and in each instance discusses the common beliefs (often dominated by religious thinking) of the time, follows that with a short account of the scientist and his discovery, and ends by considering the effect of the discovery on the future. Newton's inquiry leads to a heliocentric solar system and to space travel, Faraday's to the generation of electricity and the electric motor, Bernoulli's to the airplane, etc. Far from being dauntingly technical, Guillen's presentations show how each man overcame significant obstacles and changed the world. He is a good storyteller who will enlighten many about aspects of these five equations that even many an erstwhile engineering student does not know. <i>Alan Hirsch</i></p><h2>Believe: My Faith and the Tackle That Changed My Life</h2><p><em>Believe</em> is the profoundly moving story of Eric LeGrand, the former defensive tackle for the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights football team, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury and was left paralyzed by a crushing on-field tackle during a heated game with Army.

Despite hyperglycemia, dehydration, two blood clots, high cholesterol, pneumonia and four insulin shots a day, DeWayne was able to use his 30 years of experience in Corporate America (engineering and biochemistry) to methodically and completely wean himself off the insulin, Coumadin and other drugs to lower his average glucose level to 92.5 and his hemoglobin A1C to 4.5% -- reversing his diabetes, losing over 52 pounds, and requiring no drugs of any kind in less than 6 months. He credits his recovery to God, his doctors and nurses, his mother, his daughter Cynthia, a set of unexplained accidents (blessings), and his engineering background. With a lot of encouragement from Cynthia, his mother and various people from work, the local churches, people in the wellness industry, and the two diabetic support groups he was facilitating, DeWayne decided to write a book that explains the real root causes of Type 2 diabetes and how to beat the disease (and its complications). His hope is that this book will inspire you the way he was inspired -- by people he would never have met if it weren&#39;t for his experience with diabetes. DeWayne currently works as diabetes educator, speaker and health advocate, providing workshops and training to companies, health organizations, churches, families, wellness groups, and other community groups about diabetes, nutrition, heart disease and stroke.

Combining beautifully wrought oil paintings, a moving true story, and a unique larger format, Sacagawea will captivate readers of all ages. Kidnapped from her Shoshone tribe when she was just eleven or twelve, Sacagawea lived with her captors for four years before being given in marriage to a French Canadian fur trapper, Toussaint Charbonneau. With him, she served as interpreter, peacemaker, and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Northwest in 1805-1806. Braving hunger and fierce blizzards, Sacagawea traveled thousands of miles with a baby on her back. By the end of the legendary journey, Sacagawea's steadfast courage and capable guidance had ensured her place in history.</p></p><p><p>Lisa Erdrich was born in Breckenridge, Minnesota, and grew up in North Dakota.

Erdrich acknowledges some gaps in what is known about Sacagawea, but her picture-book account is faithful to the historical record as she quickly sketches the young woman's origins and then focuses on her experiences with Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery. Sacagawea's story is tantalizing in its brevity and irony. Brought along as a secondary figure by her opportunist husband, she evidently saved the trip from ruin on several occasions. Little is known of her after the return home, except for the fact that she gave her young son over to Captain Clark's care within a few years' time and likely died not long thereafter. The text is sometimes wooden, but the author does a fine job of describing the setting and background of the group's impressive adventure. The richly hued, impressionistic paintings also create a good sense of time and place. An afterword mentions other speculations. This solid introduction to an intriguing woman should whet readers' appetites for more on this complex chapter of American history.<br><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>New Year&#39;s Eve Murder (Lucy Stone Mysteries, No. 12)</h2><p>After the annual parade of Christmas presents in Tinker's Cove has ended, Lucy Stone and her daughter Elizabeth are ready to ring in the new year in style.

Yet in the latter years of the Middle Ages a quiet flowering of a more accessible, positive approach to Christian belief took place among a group of female mystics, those who emphasized an immediate, nonhierarchical experience of the divine.</p><p>In this enlightening volume, Wendy Farley eloquently brings the work of three female mystics&#x2014;Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Julian of Norwich&#x2014;into creative conversation with contemporary Christian life and thought. From alternatives to the standard, violent understandings of the atonement, to new forms of contemplation and prayer, these figures offer us relevant insights through a theology centered on God's love and compassion. Farley demonstrates how these women can help to refresh and expand our awareness of the depth of divine love that encompasses all creation and dwells in the cavern of every human heart.</p></p><p><p><b>Wendy Farley</b> is Professor of Religion and Ethics in the Department of Religion at Emory University. She is the author of <i>Gathering Those Driven Away: A Theology of Incarnation</i>, <i>Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: A Contemporary Theodicy</i>, and <i>The Wounding and Healing of Desire: Weaving Heaven and Earth</i>, all published by Westminster John Knox Press. </p><p>"<i>The Thirst of God</i> heals the isolation we feel when the divine love we encounter is more expansive than the traditional modes of expressing it. Farley assures us that the tradition of 'God is Love' is as ancient and complete as any that diminishes and qualifies its boldness. We may embrace all the radical potential and acceptance that statement is&#x2014;without exception or skepticism when we read this book and the theologians she covers in it. Our congregation introduced this book along with the contemplative practices of the women it covers in a retreat with fifty women and also a weekly class of thirty men and women. People who have kept the institutional church at arm's length and those who have served it for a lifetime felt a new spiritual desire awakened and claimed to be parched quite a long time for divine love expressed this way. They delighted that in Marguerite, Mechtild, Julian and Farley there was both an ancient and a future vessel to quench the thirst of a modern believer."<br>&#x2014;Beth Waltemath, Copastor, North Decatur Presbyterian Church, Decatur, Georgia</p><br><br><p>"Mechthild, Marguerite, and Julian are some of the neglected treasures of Christian theology. Accept Farley's invitation to journey with them into the depths of God's love!"<br>Amy Plantinga Pauw, Henry P. Mobley Jr. Professor of Doctrinal Theology, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary</p><br><br><p>"In an age where disillusionment with the institutional church is rampant and the message that 'love wins' is thought to be a new idea, Wendy Farley invites us into the minds and hearts of three mystics who, centuries ago, lost their lives in service to this very conviction. Farley explores the thought and passions of Mechthild of Magdeburg, Marguerite de Porete, and Julian of Norwich, inviting her readers into their belief that, though the teachings of the church are of some value, our experiences of the Trinity's capaciousness override any doctrines of sin, salvation, and judgment that compromise on the unconditional love of God.<br>I know of no work circulating today that more ably and beautifully reclaims 'heretical' ideas from the past as remedies for the hatefulness and hypocrisies of the present. In my view, Farley in this book joins hands with these three courageous and faithful women in the healing work of Lady Love."<br>&#x2014;Cynthia L. Rigby, Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary</p><br><br><p>"While historians have recovered these great Beguine mystics, Wendy Farley is the first constructive theologian to channel these women's wisdom from their medieval context into ours. She reads them so glowingly, so tenderly, so needfully, that she lures the readerwhether undergraduate, seminarian or scholarinto a contemplative activity: a loving adventure of love itself."<br>Catherine Keller, Professor of Constructive Theology, Drew University, and author of <i>The Cloud of the Impossible: Negative Theology and Planetary Entanglement</i></p><br><br><p>"Written in an engaging, available style, Wendy Farley's <i>The Thirst of God</i> ushers us into the worlds of three women theologians from the Middle Ages&#x2014;Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Madgeburg, and Julian of Norwich. It also tells the story of the Beguines, lay sisterhoods that began in the 12th century whose communities were called 'schools of love.' This ground-breaking book just might make you think differently about the hard-edged dogmatism that has often characterized Christian thought. It might encourage you to engage in contemplative practices. Most of all, it invites you to reclaim the most essential of all theological truths&#x2014;that we are loved by God. Even the footnotes in this book are not to be missed!"<br>&#x2014;Joanna Adams, Presbyterian Minister</p><br><p>"This fierce and tender book enacts the teaching of great medieval writers on divine love&#x2014;of Mechthild, Marguerite Porete, Julian of Norwich. We call these writers "mystics," but it would be better to recognize them as story-tellers of every passionate life with God. Certainly Wendy Farley tells their teachings with passion, giving her voice&#x2014;giving her compassionate desire&#x2014;to their inheritance."<br>&#x2014;Mark Jordan, Harvard University</p></p><h2>the mystery of the 8th,9th and 10th books of moses</h2><p>the object of this volume is to serve a three-fold purpose 1 the legend that is of moses the man and moses the magician 2 how the sacred writings of moses were lost 3 the book of miscellaney</p><p></p><h2>Robert the Bruce: King of Scots</h2><p><p>Robert the Bruce had himself crowned King of Scots at Scone on a frozen March morning in 1306.

Osteopathic physician and Continuum Movement teacher Bonnie Gintis offers an approach that encompasses fluid movement, open attention, and awareness of sensation and breath as empowering practices to enrich all aspects of life.

She has taught Osteopathic principles and manipulative medicine worldwide for many organizations including the Cranial Academy, the Sutherland Cranial Teaching Foundation, the American Academy of Osteopathy, the European School of Osteopathy, the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, and with James Jealous, DO.

Recent politics and logistics have established borders and jurisdictions which now seem permanent and impervious. The Faded Map looks beyond these to remember a land that was once quiet and green. It brings to vivid life the half-forgotten kings and kingdoms of two thousand years ago, of the time of the Romans, the Dark Ages and into the early medieval period. In this fascinating account, Alistair Moffat describes the landscape these men and women moved through and talks of a Celtic society which spoke to itself in Old Welsh, where the Sons of Prophesy ruled, and the time when the English kings of Bernicia held sway over vast swathes of what is now Scotland. Heroes rode out of the mists to challenge them and then join with them. The faint echo of the din of ancient battles can be heard as Alistair Moffat takes the reader on a remarkable journey around a lost Scotland.</p><p>Alistair Moffat was born and bred in the Scottish Borders. A former Director of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Director of Programmes at Scottish Television, he now runs the burgeoning Borders Book Festival as well as a production company based near Selkirk.

Dutch Courage and Cuckold&#x2019;s Comfort. These evocative nicknames for gin hint that it has a far livelier history than the simple and classic martini would lead you to believe. In this book, Lesley Jacobs Solmonson journeys into gin&#x2019;s past, revealing that this spirit has played the role of both hero and villain throughout history.</p>Taking us back to gin&#x2019;s origins as a medicine derived from the aromatic juniper berry, Solmonson describes how the Dutch recognized the berry&#x2019;s alcoholic possibilities and distilled it into the whiskey-like <i>genever</i>.

Eventually replaced by the sweetened Old Tom style and later by London Dry gin, its popularity spread along with the British Empire.

The four young ones are among the last of a dying breed&#x2014;the last hope for dragons&#x2019; survival. But hope shatters when a murderous group of slave-trader dwarves breaks into the cave, leaving a wake of death and destruction...<br> &nbsp;<br> Only young Auron, a rare, defenseless gray dragon, manages to escape. Armed with nothing but his claws and a boundless determination to survive, he sets off in search of his kind. But to find other dragons&#x2014;or, at least, find out who&#x2019;s killing them off&#x2014;Auron will have to search a world of mercenary elves, vicious humans, and dangers of all kinds. Finding allies in the strangest places&#x2014;and finding himself along the way&#x2014;Auron is about to make the trek of a lifetime.</p><p><b>E.E. Knight&nbsp;</b>was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, and now calls Chicago home, where he abides in domestic felicity with his family, and assorted pets.&nbsp; He is the author of the Vampire Earth series and the Age of Fire series.David Drummond provides a strong narrative voice for this fantasy, which revolves around Auron, a young gray dragon who must prove his cunning and intelligence in a world in which he is feared and hunted. After losing his family to hunters, he must grow up quickly and find others like him if he is to survive. While Drummond delivers strong and compelling prose, utilizing tone and rhythm to keep the story going and heightening moments of tension, he fails to deliver believable dragon voices. Granted, what makes for an authentic dragon voice is debatable. While the youth of the dragon voices accurately reflects their level of emotional development--the physiological traits of a dragon would indicate a more powerful voice.

Yet we do this all the time in organizations. Half the partnership is missing.</p><p><em>Leadership is Half the Story</em> introduces the first model to seamlessly integrate leadership, followership, and partnerships. This research-backed, field-tested book contributes many new ideas and practical advice for everyone in an organization &#x2013; from CEO to HR director to front-line manager to consultant.</p><p>All of us lead, not just those with the formal title. All of us follow, not just front-line staff. In great collaborations, one moment we are leading and then we flip to following; in other words, the relationship between leadership and followership is dynamic, context-specific, and ever-evolving. This empowering perspective opens up leadership to everyone, normalizes followership, and enables more productive and innovative collaborations. Candid discussions about both roles allow for better coaching, mentoring, skill development, and interpersonal agility, and result in stronger teams.</p><p>Marc and Samantha Hurwitz give us a category-busting book that &#x201c;practically glows with energy and vision,&#x201d; according to Marshall Goldsmith, executive coach and best-selling author of <em>What Got You Here Won&#x2019;t Get You There</em>.</p></p><p><strong>Marc Hurwitz</strong> is co-founder and Chief Insight Officer of FliPskills and a lecturer at the Conrad Centre for Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of Waterloo.

She is a coach, consultant and facilitator with twenty-five years of corporate and entrepreneurial experience, including nine at the executive level.<p> Marc and Samantha Hurwitz are making the next important development in leadership and followership studies &#x2013; weaving the behaviors of the leader and follower roles into a collaborative relationship that drives effective teams and organizations. This integrative approach will be of great interest to performance at both ends of the leader-follower dynamic. </p> (Ira Chaleff, author, 'The Courageous Follower')<br><br><p> This book is wise and entertaining. It blends research, theory, and fascinating stories from practice that can help us all to become better leaders &#x2013; and followers. It is a book to read, and then read again. </p> (Dennis Tourish, Professor of Leadership and Organisation Studies, Royal Holloway, University of London; author, 'The Dark Side of Transformational Leadership')<br><br><p> What a gift!

And it is done with solid research and practical application. </p> (Barry Johnson, author, 'Polarity Management')<br><br><p> 'Leadership Is Half the Story' is a breath of fresh air. In this very readable book, Samantha and Marc Hurwitz introduce dozens of innovative and useful insights about the dynamics of effective leadership and followership.

But writing also encompasses the many modes of communication and self-discovery that creative expression can unlock. <i>Writing Theologically</i> introduces writing not just as an academic exercise but as a way for students to communicate the good news in rapidly changing contexts, as well as to discover and craft their own sense of vocation and identity. Most important will be guiding students to how they might begin to claim and hone a distinctive theological voice that is particularly attuned to the contexts of writer and audience alike. In a collection of brief, readable essays, this volume, edited by Eric D. Barreto, emphasizes the vital skills, practices, and values involved in writing theologically. That is, how might students prepare themselves to communicate effectively and creatively, clearly and beautifully, the insights they gather during their time in seminary? Each contribution includes practical advice about best practices in writing theologically; however, the book also stresses why writing is vital in the self-understanding of the minister, as well as her or his public communication of the good news.</p><p>Eric D. Barreto is associate professor of New Testament at Luther Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and was ordained by Peachtree Baptist Church (CBF) in 2006. He earned a PhD in New Testament from Emory University. He is the author of <i>Ethnic Negotiations: The Function of Race and Ethnicity in Acts 16</i> (2010), and a regular contributor to <i>The Huffington Post</i>, WorkingPreacher.org, and EntertheBible.org."For those called to ministry and theology who are anxious about one of the essentials task of theological studies, <i>Writing Theologically</i> provides a readable and encouraging introduction to developing the skills of theological writing, not as an observer, but a practitioner. The authors provide creative guidance and practical advice that will help a person to become competent in theological writing, recognize its potential for ministry, and learn to enjoy it as well." --Edwin David Aponte, Palmer SEminary of Eastern University<br><br>"This is an about time book! About time that a courageous and insightful group of theological scholars took the time to demystify the writing process within its many modes of communication so that students, pastors, and nonprofit leaders, instead of approaching writing with fear and trepidation, can embrace the wonderful art of writing in their authentic voices to communicate the good news with clarity, creative energy, and compassion. Kudos! This is a must-read for every person of faith!" --Joanne Rodriguwz, Hispanic Theological Seminary<br><br>"At McCormick we keep talking about ways to support stronger writing and to cultivate the theological voices of our students. Here is a book that I can imagine being used by any professor in any class we teach in our curriculum, and also by our faculty as a whole to talk with each other about improving theological writing. It directly speaks to a challenge we all face." --Ted Hiebert, McCormick Theological Seminary</p><h2>A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages</h2><p>A lively, laugh-out-loud journey from Oklahoma beauty queen to show biz sensation.<br><br>&#x201c;Life&#x2019;s too short.

A lot of big girls, too. A line of blushing attendants, all picture-pretty, clutch their bouquets of roses and baby's breath, each on the arm of a dashing, tuxedoed counterpart. My best always-a-bridesmaid buddy Denny Downs is looking at me with wide, moist eyes, telling me how perfect it all is...but suddenly I'm not sure.</p><p>A moment ago, I was ready to commit myself to the faithful friend who's supported and stood by me all these years. Then Jimmy showed up, and everything became a question. Now, here I am at the eleventh hour, wondering what might happen, who will I be, if I allow my passion to be swayed by this dangerous bad boy. Crystallized moments like this one arise in every woman's life. Moments of truth in which she makes the choices that guide her destiny. Moments that ultimately write the story of her.</p><p>Sugar or spice? I agonize. Naughty or nice?</p><p>Sensible angels whisper in my ear, but the runaway bride in me is getting restless. I am a type A "leap and a net will appear" risk-taker, and if I trust that God made me this way for a reason, then I have to believe that the risk will be worth it in the long run. Experience has taught me that we all stumble and fall; faith assures me that He'll be there to catch me when I do. My heart speaks, and I listen.</p><p>I chose Jimmy.</p><p>Jimmy Choo, that is. A fabulous pair of four-inch platform slingbacks. Setting aside the safe-and-sane character shoes I was planning to wear onstage tonight, I cast my lot with the bad boy. Oh, I know what you're thinking, and, yeah, it's not exactly <i>Sophie's Choice</i>. But this is Oscar night. I'm about to step out onstage in front of thousands of people -- friends, colleagues, peers, people I hope and dream of working with -- plus my parents and everyone else watching the live broadcast on television.</p><p>People keep reminding me that billions -- with a <i>b</i> as in <i>bombastic</i> and <i>boy howdy!</i> -- yes, <i>billions</i> of people all over the world will be tuned in. Even in the coziest venues, performers can and do get hurt onstage all the time. There's a broken toe for every light on Broadway. But I'm not as concerned for myself as I am for the burgeoning cast of backup dancers. This is a huge shot of r�sum� adrenaline for most of these kids; I don't want it to turn into some tragicomic YouTube video labeled "Cheno Falls on Ass." On the other hand, when you're four feet eleven inches you get pretty comfortable in heels.</p><p>"A nice pair of Jimmy Choos never hurt anyone," I tell my friend Denny, but I take the precaution of having the soles rubbered for slip-resistance. (Faith is fine, but the Lord helps those who help themselves, right?)</p><p>I'll be performing "That's How You Know," one of three Oscar-nominated songs written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz for Disney's frothy fairy tale <i>Enchanted</i>. As Tilda Swinton collects the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for <i>Michael Clayton</i>, the backstage cavern turns into an anthill of scurrying crew members preparing for my number, which is being staged in full-on Broadway showstopper style. Joining me on the sweeping two-story set is a village-size cast including half a dozen dancing brides niftily accessorized with dancing grooms, quick-stepping waiters, acrobatically inclined construction workers, happy townies, multiculti mariachis, and (putting us indisputably over the top) a marching band. Against a miniature backdrop of Manhattan, a battalion of gorgeous guys will form sort of a hunkpowered elevator and pass me bodily off an ornate, ten-foot-tall bridge.</p><p>A great song. A magical night. Gown by Armani and travel by hunk-o-vator. I am in grave danger of thinking it doesn't get any better than this when someone tells me, "George Clooney is on the front row." I don't ask who else is on the front row. <i>Is</i> there anyone else?</p><p>George Clooney needs to know that he and I are perfect for each other. We would be instantly matched on eHarmony.com. I can already see us in that ad campaign, oozing adorable, giddily telling the story of our first kiss. Happily ever after, cue Chaka Khan, roll credits. He is my Mr. Right. The problem is, I'm still in love with Mr. Writer, a man who is more likely to show up in a "Falls on Ass" video than an "Everlasting Love" commercial. Truth be told, eHarmony would not encourage me to share so much as a cab uptown with this guy. But of course this is precisely what makes him irresistible.</p><p>Never for a moment did I even fantasize that Aaron Sorkin was Mr. Right. From the day we met, he was Mr. Sets My Brain on Fire, then he evolved for a long, lovely spell into Mr. Makes Me Sing REO Speedwagon in the Shower, but there was always an undercurrent of Mr. You Are Seriously Pushing Your Luck Here, and I eventually found myself doing the ol' step-ball-change with Mr. Why Am I Banging My Head Against This Wall? Instead of coming up with a cutesy Hollywood powercouple name for us -- "Sorkoweth" or "Chenorkin" -- the tabloids wearily call us "on again/off again," which means we periodically put each other through a wrenching spate of separation, but I keep reinstating him as Mr. Might Actually Be Worth the Trouble. We are now "off again," and it's painful to not share this amazing moment with him. I love the man, and whatever happens or doesn't happen between us in the long run, I always will.</p><p>"It's in God's hands," I tell my father whenever he shakes his head about it.</p><p>The only thing I can say with utter certainty is that come what may, my feelings for George Clooney will remain unsullied. Whatever curtains rise and fall, the "Kristlooney" dream lives on.</p><p>Hosting the Oscars tonight is Jon Stewart, who's been onstage riffing about the bitter writers' strike that was recently resolved. His wry, wisenheimer humor is good medicine for our cruel but tenderhearted community.</p><p>"Welcome to the makeup sex," he said at the start of the show, and I felt a twinge of knowing exactly what he was talking about.</p><p>Aside from my periodic reunions with Mr. If Loving You Is Wrong, I Don't Wanna Be Right, I've been holding my breath through the strike, terrified for the fate of <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, this beautiful baby bird of a TV show I've been doing. With the strike ended, we are all breathing again and anxious to get back to work this summer. Before I resume shooting the show, I'll spend the spring in New York, shoot a movie in Minneapolis, squeeze in some family time with my far-flung loved ones in Texas, Denver, and Oklahoma, do a concert with the Chicago Symphony, and give a special benefit performance for a friend in Manhattan -- all of which keeps me pleasantly occupied and comfortably distanced from L.A. with all its potential complications and painful reminders.</p><p>I make my way backstage in my Jimmy Choos. I'm getting nervous. This doesn't happen to me much anymore. Like everyone around me, I'm a seasoned pro. Stage fright is a thing of the past. But tonight, as I prepare to step onstage, a hollow, little ice cube of doubt forms in the pit of my touchy stomach. I close my eyes. <i>Heavenly Father...</i></p><p>I don't have to say anything else. He knows.</p><p>Adding one last dash of adorable to the <i>Enchanted</i> number is Vanessa Williams's little daughter Sasha, so Vanessa is here, helping her get ready. She gives me a good-luck scrunch and tells me, "Sasha's going to be right there when you look at her."</p><p>It's good to have another Broadway girl backstage. There's no unnerving a woman who's conquered the pageant circuit and delivered eight shows a week. She's a glam-cat paragon of strength and calm. Sasha's learning early what it took me years to understand.</p><p>Crew hands hustle out the set pieces. The hunks and I brace ourselves for places.</p><p>Deep breath.</p><p>Jon Stewart catches my eye.</p><p>"You're going to knock it out of the park," he assures me.</p><p>"I feel like I could pee my pants."</p><p>Jon smiles at me without a trace of wisenheimer. "Just get out there and do what you do."Copyright � 2009 by Kristin Chenoweth</p></p><h2>Citadel: A Novel</h2><p><p>France, 1942. While war blazes at the front lines of Europe, in the walled southern city of Carcassonne, nestled deep in the Pyrenees, a group of courageous women is engaged in an equally lethal battle. Like their ancestors who fought northern invaders seven hundred years before, these members of the French Resistance&#x2014;code-named Citadel&#x2014;fight to liberate their home from the Nazis.</p><p>Led by a daring eighteen-year-old, Sandrine Vidal, and her elder sister, Marianne, the women of Citadel work quickly to sabotage their German occupiers, safeguard their neighbors, and smuggle refugees over the mountains into neutral territory. But that is only part of their mission. Their struggle will reveal an older, darker combat being fought in the shadows, one meant to protect an ancient secret that in the wrong hands could change the course of history.</p><p>As the women of Citadel dare the impossible to save their homeland . . . the astonishing secrets buried in time are at long last revealed.</p></p><p>Kate Mosse Harlan Coben <p><b></b></p> <b>Harlen Coben interviews Kate Mosse, author of The Citadel</b> <p></p> <p><b>HC:</b> You&#x2019;re known for writing historical adventures set in France, but what I love about your stuff &#x2013; and what we perhaps both have in common &#x2013; is an obsession with the past haunting the present. Why are you drawn to this theme?</p> <p><b> KM:</b> 'Haunting the present', that's absolutely it. The decisions made, the mistakes, the violence of the past cast a long shadow and those affect the way people generations later behave. In the south of France- which was occupied from November 1942 to August 1944- that shadow is still there. In some villages, people still walk past the closest bakery because it's owned by a family who informed on their neighbours during the war. In Carcassonne itself, many of the main streets have been renamed in honour of resistance fighters. I knew that the date of death on each sign was the same - 19th August 1944. I became obsessed with finding out what had happened on that day. Over time, the men who died then have been identified, but on the monuments are written words that haunted me for years and were the inspiration for Citadel: 'And Two Unknown Women'. Even after years of research, I never discovered their names. But I knew I could write a novel about the sort of women they must have been - courageous, exceptional. That determination to honour the sacrifice of those unknown women led to Citadel&#x2019;s protagonist Sandrine and her all-female band of resistance fighters. </p> <p><b>HC:</b> Citadel is your first novel set during World War Two. I know you love suspense so how do you create it when, well, we already know the outcome? </p> <p><b>KM:</b> I do love suspense! Much of my reading for pleasure is crime fiction. I love a puzzle, love the business of pitting myself as a reader against the author's imagination. It's tricky, especially with World War II. But of course in adventure writing, as in crime, it's how you get there that matters. The key ingredients in adventure writing are momentum, jeopardy and emotion. Developing the characters and working out the twists and turns of the story are easily as important as the climax itself. That's what I love about writing, working it all out. </p> <p><b>HC:</b> Here&#x2019;s a research question: What was the most extraordinary story you uncovered? More to the point, what do you do when you run across great research but it won&#x2019;t fit into the story? </p> <p><b>KM:</b> I am a novelist, not a historian, and I hate the idea of 'stealing' someone's real life. I don't want to write a thinly-veiled version of a real person. I&#x2019;d rather use my research and imagination to create convincing characters who might have been. So, this is a roundabout way of answering your question. I wanted to protect the identities of people who were generous enough to share their stories with me, or the stories of their parents and grandparents. For example: the woman who showed me the trap door in the floor of their restaurant where they had sheltered Jewish children before smuggling them across the border to Spain; the son who showed me the bullet holes in the wine vats where Resistance fighters hid; the marks in the ground where the signs for the Jewish internment camps &#x2013; whose existence was denied for years - are still visible. So many incredible, dreadful, stories that would have been wrong to include. But the emotion of those stories is in Citadel and the fears, loves, pride, honour of those people appears, I hope, in some of my characters.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b>Harlan Coben is the bestselling author of sixteen previous novels, including the #1 New York Times bestsellers "Long Lost" and "Hold Tight.
